001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. 
010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 
014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 
015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 
017 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
