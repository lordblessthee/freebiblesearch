001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 
004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 
007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 
008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; 
010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 
011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
