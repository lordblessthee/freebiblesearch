001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. 
003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 
004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 
005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

010 A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject; 
011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. 
012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
014 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 
015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
