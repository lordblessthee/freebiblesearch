001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. 
002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 
003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies. 
004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. 
005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 
006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them. 
007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 
008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 
009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 
010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? 
011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded. 
012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. 
013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
