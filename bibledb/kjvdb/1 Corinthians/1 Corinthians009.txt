001 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
002 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
003 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
004 Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
005 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
006 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 
007 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
008 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
009 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 
010 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
011 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? 
012 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
013 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 
014 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. 
015 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 
016 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 
017 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. 
018 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 
019 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 
020 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
021 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 
022 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 
023 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. 
024 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
025 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 
026 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 
027 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
