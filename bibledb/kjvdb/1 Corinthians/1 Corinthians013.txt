001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 
004 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 
005 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
006 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
007 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 
008 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. 
009 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
010 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 
011 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
012 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
013 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
