001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 
002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 
003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 
004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 
005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 
007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 
009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 
010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 
011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: 
012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 
013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. 
014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. 
016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. 
017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 
018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. 
019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 
021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: 
022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 
023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. 
024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 
026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. 
027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. 
028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. 
029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 
030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. 
031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 
032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. 
033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 
034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 
035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
