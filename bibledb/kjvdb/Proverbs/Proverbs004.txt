001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. 
002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 
004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. 
005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. 
007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. 
009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 
010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. 
011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 
012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. 
014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. 
015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. 
016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. 
017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. 
018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 
019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. 
020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 
021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. 
022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. 
023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. 
024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. 
025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. 
026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. 
027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
