001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 
002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 
003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 
004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. 
005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want. 
006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 
007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 
008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right. 
009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 
010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 
011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 
012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. 
013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 
014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 
015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. 
016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 
017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 
018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 
019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 
020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 
021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 
022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 
023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 
024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 
025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 
026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 
027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 
028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 
029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. 
030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 
031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.
