002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. 
003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. 
004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. 
005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 
006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 
007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him. 
008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 
009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 
010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. 
011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 
012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 
013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 
015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 
016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 
018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. 
019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 
020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 
021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.

024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 
025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry. 
026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. 
027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. 
028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 
029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head. 
030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
