001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 
002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 
003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 
005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 
007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 
008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 
009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 
010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 
011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 
012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 
013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 
014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. 
015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 
016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 
017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 
019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 
020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 
022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 
023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 
024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 
026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 
029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 
030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 
031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 
032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 
034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 
035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
