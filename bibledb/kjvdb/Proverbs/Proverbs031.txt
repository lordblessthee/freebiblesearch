001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 
002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 
003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 
004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 
005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 
006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 
007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 
008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 
009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 
010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 
011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 
012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 
013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 
014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 
015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 
016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 
017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 
018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. 
019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 
020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 
021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 
022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. 
023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 
024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 
025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 
026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 
027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 
028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 
029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 
030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 
031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
