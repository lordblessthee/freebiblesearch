001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 
003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. 
004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. 
005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 
006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 
007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 
008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. 
009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 
010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 
012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 
013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. 
015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 
016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 
017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 
018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. 
019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 
020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 
021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. 
022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 
023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 
024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. 
025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: 
026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 
027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 
028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 
030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; 
031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. 
032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. 
033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 
034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 
035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 
036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
