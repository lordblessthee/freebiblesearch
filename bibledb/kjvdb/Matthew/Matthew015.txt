001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 
002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? 
004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 
005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. 
007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 
008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 
009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 
010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. 
015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 
018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 
020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. 
021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and cast it to dogs. 
027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. 
029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: 
031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 
034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 
035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. 
038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 
039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
