001 But Job answered and said, 
002 Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 
004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 
005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 
007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. 
008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 
009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 
010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 
013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 
014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; 
016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 
017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 
019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 
020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 
021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. 
022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 
023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 
024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 
025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 
026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 
027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 
028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 
029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. 
030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
