001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 
003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 
004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 
005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 
006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? 
009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 
010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 
011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 
012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. 
016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 
018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. 
019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, 
020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 
021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? 
022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 
023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 
024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 
025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 
027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 
028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 
030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 
031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 
032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 
033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 
034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 
035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? 
036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 
039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
