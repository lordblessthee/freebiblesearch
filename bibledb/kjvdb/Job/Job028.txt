001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 
002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 
003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: 
008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 
016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. 
018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 
025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
