001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 
003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 
004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 
005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 
006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. 
007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 
008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 
009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 
010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 
011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? 
012 For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. 
013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 
014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 
016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 
017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 
020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
