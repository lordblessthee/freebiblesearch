001 Then Job answered and said, 
002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 
005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. 
006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 
007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: 
010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 
013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. 
014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. 
015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 
016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
