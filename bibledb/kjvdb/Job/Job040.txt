001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 
002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 
003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 
005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 
006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 
008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 
010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 
011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. 
012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 
013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. 
014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 
015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 
016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. 
017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 
018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. 
019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 
020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 
021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 
022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 
023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
