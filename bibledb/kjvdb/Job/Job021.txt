001 But Job answered and said, 
002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 
009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 
010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 
012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. 
020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 
024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 
026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 
027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 
028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 
029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 
032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 
033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. 
034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
