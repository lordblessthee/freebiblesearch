001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 
002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? 
004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 
007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 
008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 
009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 
011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 
012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 
013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 
014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 
015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. 
020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 
021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 
023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 
024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 
025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
