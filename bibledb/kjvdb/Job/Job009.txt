001 Then Job answered and said, 
002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 
003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 
005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 
006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 
007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 
008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 
009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 
011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 
012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 
013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. 
014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? 
015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. 
016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 
019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? 
020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 
021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 
022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? 
025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 
026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 
027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: 
028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 
029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 
030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 
032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 
033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 
034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 
035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
