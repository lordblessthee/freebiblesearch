001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 
003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 
005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 
007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 
008 For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 
010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 
011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 
013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 
014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. 
015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 
016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 
017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. 
018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 
019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 
020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: 
021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
