001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. 
003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? 
004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 
005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 
006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. 
007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. 
008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 
009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him. 
010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 
011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 
012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. 
013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 
014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 
015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. 
017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 
018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 
019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. 
020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. 
021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
