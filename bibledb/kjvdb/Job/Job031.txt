001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 
002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 
004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 
005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. 
007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 
009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; 
010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 
011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 
013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 
014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 
016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 
018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 
019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 
020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 
022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 
023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 
024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 
025 If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 
026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 
027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 
028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. 
029 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 
030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 
031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. 
032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. 
033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 
034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 
035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. 
036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. 
037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 
038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 
039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
