001 Then Job answered and said, 
002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 
003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. 
004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. 
005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 
006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 
007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. 
008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 
009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 
010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. 
011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. 
012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 
013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 
014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 
015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 
016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth. 
017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's sake of mine own body. 
018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 
019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 
022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 
024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 
025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 
026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. 
028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 
029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
