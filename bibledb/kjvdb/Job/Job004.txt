001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 
003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 
005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 
007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 
008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 
009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 
010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. 
012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. 
013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 
014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 
015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 
016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 
017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 
018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 
019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? 
020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 
021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
