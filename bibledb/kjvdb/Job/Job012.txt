001 And Job answered and said, 
002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. 
003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 
004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. 
005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 
007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 
008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 
009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 
010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. 
011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 
013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 
014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 
015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. 
017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. 
018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. 
024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 
025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
