001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 
004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 
005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 
007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 
008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 
009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 
010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 
011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 
012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? 
013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 
014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 
015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 
016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 
017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. 
021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 
022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 
023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 
024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 
025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 
027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 
028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. 
030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
