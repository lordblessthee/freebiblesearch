001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. 
002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 
003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? 
004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. 
005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 
007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. 
008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 
010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. 
011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. 
012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. 
013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 
014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. 
015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? 
016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
