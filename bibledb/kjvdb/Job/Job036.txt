001 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. 
003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 
005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 
006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 
007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; 
009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 
011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 
013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 
014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. 
015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 
016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 
017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. 
018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 
020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 
021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 
023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 
025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. 
026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 
028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. 
029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 
030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 
031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 
032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. 
033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
