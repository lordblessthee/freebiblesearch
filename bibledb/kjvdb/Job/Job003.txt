001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
002 And Job spake, and said, 
003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 
005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 
006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 
007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 
008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 
013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 
014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; 
015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 
016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. 
017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 
018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 
019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. 
020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; 
021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 
023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 
024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 
026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
