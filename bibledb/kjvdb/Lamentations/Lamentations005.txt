001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. 
002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 
003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. 
004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 
005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. 
006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 
008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. 
009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 
010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. 
011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. 
012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 
013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. 
014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. 
015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! 
017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. 
018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. 
019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. 
020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? 
021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 
022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
