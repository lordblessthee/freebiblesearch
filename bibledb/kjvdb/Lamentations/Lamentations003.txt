001 I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 
002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. 
003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. 
004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old: he hath broken my bones. 
005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 
006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. 
007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 
008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 
009 He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 
010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. 
011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. 
012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 
013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. 
015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 
016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 
017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 
018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 
019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 
020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 
021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. 
022 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 
023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. 
024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. 
025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. 
026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 
027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. 
029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 
030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. 
031 For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 
032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 
033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 
034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 
035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 
036 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 
037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? 
038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 
039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 
040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 
041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 
042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. 
043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 
044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. 
045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 
046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 
048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 
050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 
051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 
052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 
053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 
054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. 
055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 
056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 
057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 
058 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 
059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 
060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. 
061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; 
062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. 
063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their music. 
064 Render unto them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 
065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 
066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
