001 O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 
002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. 
003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 
004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 
006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 
007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 
008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. 
009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
