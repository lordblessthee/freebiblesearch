001 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. 
002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. 
003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. 
004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. 
005 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 
006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. 
007 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. 
008 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; 
009 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. 
010 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
011 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 
012 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 
013 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. 
014 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 
015 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, 
016 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; 
017 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. 
018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. 
019 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 
020 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
021 And having an high priest over the house of God; 
022 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 
025 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. 
026 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
027 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 
028 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: 
029 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
030 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. 
031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
032 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 
033 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. 
034 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. 
035 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. 
036 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. 
037 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. 
038 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
039 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
