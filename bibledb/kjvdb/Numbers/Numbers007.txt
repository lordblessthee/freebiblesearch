001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them; 
002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: 
003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 
004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 
006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. 
010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. 
011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.
