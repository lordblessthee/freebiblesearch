001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. 
002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 
003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 
004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. 
005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 
006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 
008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 
010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 
011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 
012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 
014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 
015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 
016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 
018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 
019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 
021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 
022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
