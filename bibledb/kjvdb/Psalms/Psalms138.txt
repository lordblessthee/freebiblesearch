001 A Psalm of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. 
002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 
004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 
005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. 
006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. 
007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. 
008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
