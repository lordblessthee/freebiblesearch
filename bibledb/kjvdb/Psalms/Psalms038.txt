001 A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. 
003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 
004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 
006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 
007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. 
010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 
011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. 
013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. 
015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 
017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. 
018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 
019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. 
021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 
022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
