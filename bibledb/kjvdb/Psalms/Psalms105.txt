001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 
002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 
005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 
007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 
008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. 
009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 
010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 
011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 
012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 
013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; 
014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. 
017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: 
018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 
019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 
020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 
021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 
022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 
023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 
025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants. 
026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 
027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 
029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 
031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. 
032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 
033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. 
034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number, 
035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 
036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 
037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 
038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. 
039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 
040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 
042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 
043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: 
044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 
045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
