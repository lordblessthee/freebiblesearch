001 A Song of degrees. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 
002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 
004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 
005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 
006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
