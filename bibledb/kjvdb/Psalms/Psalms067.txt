001 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 
002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 
003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 
004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 
005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 
006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. 
007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
