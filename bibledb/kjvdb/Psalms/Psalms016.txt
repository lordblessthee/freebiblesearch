001 Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 
002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; 
003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 
004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. 
005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 
006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 
007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 
008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 
010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
