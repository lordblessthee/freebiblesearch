001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 
003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised. 
004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 
005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, 
006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 
007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 
008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
