001 A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. 
002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
005 I have hated the congregation of evildoers; and will not sit with the wicked. 
006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 
007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 
010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 
012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
