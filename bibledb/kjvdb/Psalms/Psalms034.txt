001 A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 
002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. 
003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 
006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 
007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 
008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 
009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 
010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. 
011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 
013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 
016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. 
018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 
019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 
020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. 
022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
