001 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; 
002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 
003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 
004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 
005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 
006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 
007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 
008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 
009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
