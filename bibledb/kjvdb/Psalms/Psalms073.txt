001 A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. 
002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. 
003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. 
005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. 
006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. 
007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. 
008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. 
009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. 
011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? 
012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. 
013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. 
014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. 
015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. 
016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; 
017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. 
018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. 
019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. 
020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. 
021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 
022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. 
023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. 
024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. 
025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. 
026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 
027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. 
028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
