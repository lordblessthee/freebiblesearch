001 A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 
003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 
004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 
005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
