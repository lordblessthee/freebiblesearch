001 A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 
006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 
010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
