001 A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. 
002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 
004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 
005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away. 
006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 
007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 
008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 
013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 
014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
