001 To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 
004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. 
005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 
006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
