001 A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 
003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 
005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. 
007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. 
008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 
009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. 
010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 
012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 
014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. 
017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; 
018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 
019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
