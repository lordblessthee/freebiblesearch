001 A Song of degrees of David. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; 
002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 
003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
