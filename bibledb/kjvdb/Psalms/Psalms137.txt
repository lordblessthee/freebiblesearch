001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 
002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 
003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 
004 How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? 
005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 
006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof. 
008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 
009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
