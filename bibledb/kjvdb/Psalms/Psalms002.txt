001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, 
003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 
004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 
005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 
006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 
007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 
008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 
009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 
010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
