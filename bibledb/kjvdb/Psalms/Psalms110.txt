001 A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 
002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 
007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
