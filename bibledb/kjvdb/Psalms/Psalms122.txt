001 A Song of degrees of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 
002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 
004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 
005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 
007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 
009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
