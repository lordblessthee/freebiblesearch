001 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. 
002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 
003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 
004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 
005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 
006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 
007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. 
008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? 
009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 
010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? 
011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 
012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 
013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 
014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 
016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 
019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 
020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 
021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 
022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. 
023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
