001 Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 
002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
003 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 
005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 
006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. 
007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. 
009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 
010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. 
011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. 
012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 
014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 
015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 
016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 
017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
