001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 
003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 
004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. 
005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 
006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 
007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 
008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 
009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; 
010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. 
011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 
014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. 
016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
