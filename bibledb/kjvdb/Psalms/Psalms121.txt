001 A Song of degrees. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 
002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 
003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 
007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 
008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
