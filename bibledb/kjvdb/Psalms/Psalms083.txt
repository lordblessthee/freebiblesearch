001 A Song or Psalm of Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 
004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: 
006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 
009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 
010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 
011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 
012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 
013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 
014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 
015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 
017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 
018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
