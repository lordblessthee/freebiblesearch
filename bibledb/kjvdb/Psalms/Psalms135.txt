001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD. 
002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God, 
003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 
004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 
007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 
011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 
012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 
013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 
014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 
015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 
017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. 
019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: 
020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. 
021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
