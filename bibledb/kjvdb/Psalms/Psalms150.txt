001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 
002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 
003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
