001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 
005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 
006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 
007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners: 
008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous: 
009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 
010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
