001 To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. 
002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred. 
003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue, 
004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. 
005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah. 
006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee. 
008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. 
009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. 
010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. 
011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah. 
012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were. 
013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
