001 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 
002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 
005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. 
006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. 
007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
