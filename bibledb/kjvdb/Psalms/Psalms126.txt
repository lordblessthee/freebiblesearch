001 A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 
002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 
003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 
004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 
005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
