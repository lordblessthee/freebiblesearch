001 A Song of degrees. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 
002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 
003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 
004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 
006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 
007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
