001 A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 
002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. 
003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. 
004 shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 
005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 
006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. 
007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 
008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 
009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. 
010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. 
012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. 
013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 
014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. 
015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 
016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted. 
017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. 
018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 
019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. 
021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. 
022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
