001 A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions: 
002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 
003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 
004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 
005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 
006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 
007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 
008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 
010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 
013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 
014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 
018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
