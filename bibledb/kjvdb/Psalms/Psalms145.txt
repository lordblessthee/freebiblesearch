001 David's Psalm of praise. I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. 
004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. 
005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. 
006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. 
007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 
008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 
009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. 
010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. 
011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 
012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 
014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down. 
015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 
016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 
019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. 
020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. 
021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
