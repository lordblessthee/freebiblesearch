001 To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 
002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 
003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 
004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 
005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 
007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 
008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? 
009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. 
010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 
011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 
012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 
013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
