001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 
004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. 
005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 
006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 
007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 
008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 
010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 
011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 
012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. 
013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 
014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 
015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 
019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. 
020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. 
021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 
023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 
024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 
025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 
026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 
027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. 
028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. 
030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; 
034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 
035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. 
036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 
037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 
038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 
039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. 
041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 
042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
