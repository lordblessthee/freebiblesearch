001 A Psalm of David. Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 
004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 
005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 
008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 
011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
