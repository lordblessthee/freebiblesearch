001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 
002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 
003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 
004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 
005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 
007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 
008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 
010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
