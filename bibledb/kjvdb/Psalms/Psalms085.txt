001 To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. 
003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 
004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. 
005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 
006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? 
007 shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 
008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. 
009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 
012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. 
013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
