001 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 
002 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. 
004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 
005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 
011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 
012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. 
013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 
014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 
016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 
017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
