001 A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 
002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 
003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 
004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. 
005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 
006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 
007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 
008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. 
009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, 
010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 
012 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. 
013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 
014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. 
015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. 
017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 
018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 
019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 
020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 
021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 
024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 
025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 
027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 
028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
