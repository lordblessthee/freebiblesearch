001 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 
002 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
003 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 
004 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
005 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
006 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. 
007 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
008 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
009 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
010 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 
011 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. 
012 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
013 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. 
014 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. 
015 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. 
016 Rejoice evermore. 
017 Pray without ceasing. 
018 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
019 Quench not the Spirit. 
020 Despise not prophesyings. 
021 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
022 Abstain from all appearance of evil. 
023 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
024 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. 
025 Brethren, pray for us. 
026 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 
027 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. 
028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
