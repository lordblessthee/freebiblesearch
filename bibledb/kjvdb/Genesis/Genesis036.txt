001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 
002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 
004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 
006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 
008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 
009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 
010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 
011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. 
015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 
016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 
017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 
019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes. 
020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 
021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. 
025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 
027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan. 
028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. 
029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 
030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 
031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 
032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 
035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 
036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 
038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 
040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 
041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 
042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 
043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
