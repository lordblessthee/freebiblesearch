001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 
002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 
007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 
010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 
012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 
013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 
015 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 
016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 
017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 
019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 
020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 
021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. 
022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 
023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 
027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. 
030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 
031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
