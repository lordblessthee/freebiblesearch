001 And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;  
002 and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;  
003 and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;  
004 and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,  
005 and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.  
006 And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;  
007 and he maketh two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he hath made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;  
008 one cherub at the end on this `side', and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends; 
009 and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces `are' one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been. 
010 And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,  
011 and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about.  
012 And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;  
013 and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which `are' to its four feet; 
014 over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.  
015 And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold, to bear the table;  
016 and he maketh the vessels which `are' upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold. 
017 And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;  
018 and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;  
019 three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.  
020 And in the candlestick `are' four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers, 
021 and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, `are' to the six branches which are coming out of it; 
022 their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.  
023 And he maketh its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;  
024 of a talent of pure gold he hath made it, and all its vessels.  
025 And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;  
026 and he overlayeth it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;  
027 and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.  
028 And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold;  
029 and he maketh the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfume -- work of a compounder.
