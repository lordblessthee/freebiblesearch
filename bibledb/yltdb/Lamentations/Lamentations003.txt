001 I `am' the man `who' hath seen affliction By the rod of His wrath. 
002 Me He hath led, and causeth to go `in' darkness, and without light. 
003 Surely against me He turneth back, He turneth His hand all the day.  
004 He hath worn out my flesh and my skin. He hath broken my bones.  
005 He hath built up against me, And setteth round poverty and weariness.  
006 In dark places He hath caused me to dwell, As the dead of old.  
007 He hath hedged me about, and I go not out, He hath made heavy my fetter.  
008 Also when I call and cry out, He hath shut out my prayer.  
009 He hath hedged my ways with hewn work, My paths He hath made crooked.  
010 A bear lying in wait He `is' to me, A lion in secret hiding-places. 
011 My ways He is turning aside, and He pulleth me in pieces, He hath made me a desolation.  
012 He hath trodden His bow, And setteth me up as a mark for an arrow.  
013 He hath caused to enter into my reins The sons of His quiver.  
014 I have been a derision to all my people, Their song all the day.  
015 He hath filled me with bitter things, He hath filled me `with' wormwood. 
016 And He breaketh with gravel my teeth, He hath covered me with ashes.  
017 And Thou castest off from peace my soul, I have forgotten prosperity.  
018 And I say, Perished hath my strength and my hope from Jehovah.  
019 Remember my affliction and my mourning, Wormwood and gall!  
020 Remember well, and bow down doth my soul in me.  
021 This I turn to my heart -- therefore I hope.  
022 The kindnesses of Jehovah! For we have not been consumed, For not ended have His mercies.  
023 New every morning, abundant `is' thy faithfulness. 
024 My portion `is' Jehovah, hath my soul said, Therefore I hope for Him. 
025 Good `is' Jehovah to those waiting for Him, To the soul `that' seeketh Him. 
026 Good! when one doth stay and stand still For the salvation of Jehovah.  
027 Good for a man that he beareth a yoke in his youth.  
028 He sitteth alone, and is silent, For He hath laid `it' upon him. 
029 He putteth in the dust his mouth, if so be there is hope.  
030 He giveth to his smiter the cheek, He is filled with reproach.  
031 For the Lord doth not cast off to the age.  
032 For though He afflicted, yet He hath pitied, According to the abundance of His kindness.  
033 For He hath not afflicted with His heart, Nor doth He grieve the sons of men.  
034 To bruise under one's feet any bound ones of earth,  
035 To turn aside the judgment of a man, Over-against the face of the Most High,  
036 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord hath not approved.  
037 Who `is' this -- he hath said, and it is, `And' the Lord hath not commanded `it'? 
038 From the mouth of the Most High Go not forth the evils and the good.  
039 What -- sigh habitually doth a living man, A man for his sin?  
040 We search our ways, and investigate, And turn back unto Jehovah.  
041 We lift up our heart on the hands unto God in the heavens.  
042 We -- we have transgressed and rebelled, Thou -- Thou hast not forgiven.  
043 Thou hast covered Thyself with anger, And dost pursue us; Thou hast slain -- Thou hast not pitied.  
044 Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, So that prayer doth not pass through.  
045 Offscouring and refuse Thou dost make us In the midst of the peoples.  
046 Opened against us their mouth have all our enemies.  
047 Fear and a snare hath been for us, Desolation and destruction.  
048 Rivulets of water go down my eye, For the destruction of the daughter of my people.  
049 Mine eye is poured out, And doth not cease without intermission,  
050 Till Jehovah looketh and seeth from the heavens,  
051 My eye affecteth my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.  
052 Hunted me sore as a bird have my enemies without cause.  
053 They have cut off in a pit my life, And they cast a stone against me.  
054 Flowed have waters over my head, I have said, I have been cut off.  
055 I called Thy name, O Jehovah, from the lower pit.  
056 My voice Thou hast heard, Hide not Thine ear at my breathing -- at my cry.  
057 Thou hast drawn near in the day I call Thee, Thou hast said, Fear not.  
058 Thou hast pleaded, O Lord, the pleadings of my soul, Thou hast redeemed my life.  
059 Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, my overthrow, Judge Thou my cause.  
060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance, All their thoughts of me.  
061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, All their thoughts against me,  
062 The lips of my withstanders, Even their meditation against me all the day.  
063 Their sitting down, and their rising up, Behold attentively, I `am' their song. 
064 Thou returnest to them the deed, O Jehovah, According to the work of their hands.  
065 Thou givest to them a covered heart, Thy curse to them.  
066 Thou pursuest in anger, and destroyest them, From under the heavens of Jehovah!
