001 Remember, O Jehovah, what hath befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.  
002 Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.  
003 Orphans we have been -- without a father, our mothers `are' as widows. 
004 Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price doth come.  
005 For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured -- there hath been no rest for us.  
006 `To' Egypt we have given a hand, `To' Asshur, to be satisfied with bread. 
007 Our fathers have sinned -- they are not, We their iniquities have borne.  
008 Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.  
009 With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.  
010 Our skin as an oven hath been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.  
011 Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins -- in cities of Judah.  
012 Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.  
013 Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.  
014 The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.  
015 Ceased hath the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning hath been our dancing.  
016 Fallen hath the crown `from' our head, Wo `is' now to us, for we have sinned. 
017 For this hath our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.  
018 For the mount of Zion -- that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.  
019 Thou, O Jehovah, to the age remainest, Thy throne to generation and generation.  
020 Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!  
021 Turn us back, O Jehovah, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.  
022 For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us -- exceedingly?
