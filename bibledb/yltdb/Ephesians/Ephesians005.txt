001 Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,  
002 and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell,  
003 and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;  
004 also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, -- the things not fit -- but rather thanksgiving;  
005 for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God.  
006 Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,  
007 become not, then, partakers with them,  
008 for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk ye,  
009 for the fruit of the Spirit `is' in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth, 
010 proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,  
011 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict,  
012 for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,  
013 and all the things reproved by the light are manifested, for everything that is manifested is light;  
014 wherefore he saith, `Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'  
015 See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise,  
016 redeeming the time, because the days are evil;  
017 because of this become not fools, but -- understanding what `is' the will of the Lord, 
018 and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in the Spirit,  
019 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,  
020 giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;  
021 subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.  
022 The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to the Lord,  
023 because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ `is' head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body, 
024 but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also `are' the wives to their own husbands in everything. 
025 The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,  
026 that he might sanctify it, having cleansed `it' with the bathing of the water in the saying, 
027 that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;  
028 so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife -- himself he doth love;  
029 for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord -- the assembly,  
030 because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;  
031 `for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh;'  
032 this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly; 
033 but ye also, every one in particular -- let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife -- that she may reverence the husband.
