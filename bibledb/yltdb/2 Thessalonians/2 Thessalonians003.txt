001 As to the rest, pray ye, brethren, concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as also with you,  
002 and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for the faith `is' not of all; 
003 and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall guard `you' from the evil; 
004 and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the things that we command you ye both do and will do;  
005 and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ.  
006 And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking, and not after the deliverance that ye received from us,  
007 for yourselves have known how it behoveth `you' to imitate us, because we did not act disorderly among you; 
008 nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to any of you;  
009 not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you, to imitate us;  
010 for even when we were with you, this we did command you, that if any one is not willing to work, neither let him eat,  
011 for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but over working,  
012 and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may eat;  
013 and ye, brethren, may ye not be weary doing well,  
014 and if any one do not obey our word through the letter, this one note ye, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed,  
015 and as an enemy count `him' not, but admonish ye `him' as a brother; 
016 and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord `is' with you all! 
017 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write;  
018 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you all! Amen.
