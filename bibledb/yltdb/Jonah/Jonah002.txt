001 And Jonah prayeth unto Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish.  
002 And he saith: I called, because of my distress, to Jehovah, And He doth answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, Thou hast heard my voice.  
003 When Thou dost cast me `into' the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood doth compass me, All Thy breakers and Thy billows have passed over me. 
004 And I -- I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Thy holy temple!)  
005 Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep doth compass me, The weed is bound to my head.  
006 To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars `are' behind me to the age. And Thou bringest up from the pit my life, O Jehovah my God. 
007 In the feebleness within me of my soul Jehovah I have remembered, And come in unto Thee doth my prayer, Unto Thy holy temple.  
008 Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.  
009 And I -- with a voice of thanksgiving -- I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation `is' of Jehovah. 
010 And Jehovah saith to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land.
