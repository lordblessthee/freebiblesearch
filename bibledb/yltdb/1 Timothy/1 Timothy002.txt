001 I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:  
002 for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,  
003 for this `is' right and acceptable before God our Saviour, 
004 who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;  
005 for one `is' God, one also `is' mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus, 
006 who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --  
007 in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.  
008 I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;  
009 in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,  
010 but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works.  
011 Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,  
012 and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,  
013 for Adam was first formed, then Eve,  
014 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,  
015 and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
