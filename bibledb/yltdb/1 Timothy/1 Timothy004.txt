001 And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,  
002 in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,  
003 forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,  
004 because every creature of God `is' good, and nothing `is' to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received, 
005 for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.  
006 These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,  
007 and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,  
008 for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;  
009 stedfast `is' the word, and of all acceptation worthy; 
010 for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing.  
011 Charge these things, and teach;  
012 let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;  
013 till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;  
014 be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;  
015 of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;  
016 take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee.
