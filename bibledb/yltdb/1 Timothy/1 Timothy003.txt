001 Stedfast `is' the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth; 
002 it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,  
003 not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,  
004 his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,  
005 (and if any one his own house `how' to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?) 
006 not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;  
007 and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.  
008 Ministrants -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,  
009 having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,  
010 and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.  
011 Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.  
012 Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,  
013 for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that `is' in Christ Jesus. 
014 These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,  
015 and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth `thee' to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the truth, 
016 and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!
