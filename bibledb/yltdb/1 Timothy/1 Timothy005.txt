001 An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;  
002 aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all purity;  
003 honour widows who are really widows;  
004 and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.  
005 And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,  
006 and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;  
007 and these things charge, that they may be blameless;  
008 and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.  
009 A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,  
010 in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;  
011 and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,  
012 having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,  
013 and at the same time also, they learn `to be' idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not; 
014 I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;  
015 for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.  
016 If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.  
017 The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,  
018 for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and `Worthy `is' the workman of his reward.' 
019 Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.  
020 Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;  
021 I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.  
022 Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;  
023 no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;  
024 of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;  
025 in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.
