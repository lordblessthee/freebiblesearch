001 And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith: --  
002 Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it.  
003 And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith: --  
004 Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I have placed on my mouth.  
005 Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add not.  
006 And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: --  
007 Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.  
008 Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me, That thou mayest be righteous?  
009 And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?  
010 Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour and beauty put on.  
011 Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every proud one, and make him low.  
012 See every proud one -- humble him, And tread down the wicked in their place.  
013 Hide them in the dust together, Their faces bind in secret.  
014 And even I -- I do praise thee, For thy right hand giveth salvation to thee.  
015 Lo, I pray thee, Behemoth, that I made with thee: Grass as an ox he eateth.  
016 Lo, I pray thee, his power `is' in his loins, And his strength in the muscles of his belly. 
017 He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together,  
018 His bones `are' tubes of brass, His bones `are' as a bar of iron. 
019 He `is' a beginning of the ways of God, His Maker bringeth nigh his sword; 
020 For food do mountains bear for him, And all the beasts of the field play there.  
021 Under shades he lieth down, In a secret place of reed and mire.  
022 Cover him do shades, `with' their shadow, Cover him do willows of the brook. 
023 Lo, a flood oppresseth -- he doth not haste, He is confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth.  
024 Before his eyes doth `one' take him, With snares doth `one' pierce the nose?
