001 And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and `to' all my words give ear. 
002 Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate.  
003 Of the uprightness of my heart `are' my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken. 
004 The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me.  
005 If thou art able -- answer me, Set in array before me -- station thyself.  
006 Lo, I `am', according to thy word, for God, From the clay I -- I also, have been formed. 
007 Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy.  
008 Surely -- thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:  
009 `Pure `am' I, without transgression, Innocent `am' I, and I have no iniquity. 
010 Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,  
011 He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.'  
012 Lo, `in' this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man. 
013 Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When `for' all His matters He answereth not? 
014 For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)  
015 In a dream -- a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.  
016 Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:  
017 To turn aside man `from' doing, And pride from man He concealeth. 
018 He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart.  
019 And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones `is' enduring. 
020 And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food.  
021 His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!  
022 And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death.  
023 If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter -- one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:  
024 Then He doth favour him and saith, `Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.'  
025 Fresher `is' his flesh than a child's, He returneth to the days of his youth. 
026 He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness.  
027 He looketh on men, and saith, `I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.  
028 He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.'  
029 Lo, all these doth God work, Twice -- thrice with man,  
030 To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living.  
031 Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I -- I do speak.  
032 If there are words -- answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee.  
033 If there are not -- hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom.
