001 After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.  
002 And Job answereth and saith: --  
003 Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.'  
004 That day -- let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it.  
005 Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days.  
006 That night -- let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come.  
007 Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it.  
008 Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan.  
009 Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of the dawn.  
010 Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.  
011 Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!  
012 Wherefore have knees been before me? And what `are' breasts, that I suck? 
013 For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept -- then there is rest to me,  
014 With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes for themselves.  
015 Or with princes -- they have gold, They are filling their houses `with' silver. 
016 (Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants -- they have not seen light.)  
017 There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do the wearied in power.  
018 Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard the voice of an exactor,  
019 Small and great `are' there the same. And a servant `is' free from his lord. 
020 Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the bitter soul?  
021 Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures.  
022 Who are glad -- unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave.  
023 To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?  
024 For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters `are' my roarings. 
025 For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me.  
026 I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest -- and trouble cometh!
