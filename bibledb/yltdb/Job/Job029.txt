001 And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --  
002 Who doth make me as `in' months past, As `in' the days of God's preserving me? 
003 In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk `through' darkness. 
004 As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent.  
005 When yet the Mighty One `is' with me. Round about me -- my young ones, 
006 When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock `is' with me rivulets of oil. 
007 When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat.  
008 Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen -- they stood up.  
009 Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth.  
010 The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved.  
011 For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth `to' me. 
012 For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper.  
013 The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing.  
014 Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice.  
015 Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame `am' I. 
016 A father I `am' to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out. 
017 And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey.  
018 And I say, `With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.'  
019 My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch.  
020 My honour `is' fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed. 
021 To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel.  
022 After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,  
023 And they wait as `for' rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide `As' for the latter rain. 
024 I laugh unto them -- they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall.  
025 I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.
