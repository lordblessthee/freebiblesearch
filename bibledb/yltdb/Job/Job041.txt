001 Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down -- his tongue?  
002 Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?  
003 Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?  
004 Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?  
005 Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?  
006 (Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the merchants!)  
007 Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?  
008 Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle -- do not add!  
009 Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance is not one cast down?  
010 None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who `is' he before Me stationeth himself? 
011 Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it `is' mine. 
012 I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter of might, And the grace of his arrangement.  
013 Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?  
014 The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth `are' terrible. 
015 A pride -- strong ones of shields, Shut up -- a close seal.  
016 One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter between them.  
017 One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are not separated.  
018 His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes `are' as the eyelids of the dawn. 
019 Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.  
020 Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and reeds.  
021 His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his mouth goeth forth.  
022 In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief exult.  
023 The flakes of his flesh have adhered -- Firm upon him -- it is not moved.  
024 His heart `is' firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower piece. 
025 From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings they keep themselves free.  
026 The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear -- dart -- and lance.  
027 He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.  
028 The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by him into stubble are stones of the sling.  
029 As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.  
030 Under him `are' sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on the mire. 
031 He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as a pot of ointment.  
032 After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the deep to be hoary.  
033 There is not on the earth his like, That is made without terror.  
034 Every high thing he doth see, He `is' king over all sons of pride.
