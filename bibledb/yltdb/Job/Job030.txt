001 And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock.  
002 Also -- the power of their hands, why `is it' to me? On them hath old age perished. 
003 With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,  
004 Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots `is' their food. 
005 From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),  
006 In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts.  
007 Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together.  
008 Sons of folly -- even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land.  
009 And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword.  
010 They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit.  
011 Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away.  
012 On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity.  
013 They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, `He hath no helper.'  
014 As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves.  
015 He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away.  
016 And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction.  
017 At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down.  
018 By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me.  
019 Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.  
020 I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me.  
021 Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppresest me.  
022 Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest -- Thou levellest me.  
023 For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And `to' the house appointed for all living. 
024 Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety.  
025 Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.  
026 When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for light, and darkness cometh.  
027 My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction.  
028 Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry.  
029 A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich.  
030 My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,  
031 And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping.
