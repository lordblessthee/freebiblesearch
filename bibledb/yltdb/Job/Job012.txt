001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 Truly -- ye `are' the people, And with you doth wisdom die. 
003 I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, And with whom is there not like these?  
004 A laughter to his friend I am: `He calleth to God, and He answereth him,' A laughter `is' the perfect righteous one. 
005 A torch -- despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet.  
006 At peace are the tents of spoilers, And those provoking God have confidence, He into whose hand God hath brought.  
007 And yet, ask, I pray thee, `One of' the beasts, and it doth shew thee, And a fowl of the heavens, And it doth declare to thee. 
008 Or talk to the earth, and it sheweth thee, And fishes of the sea recount to thee:  
009 `Who hath not known in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this?  
010 In whose hand `is' the breath of every living thing, And the spirit of all flesh of man.' 
011 Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?  
012 With the very aged `is' wisdom, And `with' length of days understanding. 
013 With Him `are' wisdom and might, To him `are' counsel and understanding. 
014 Lo, He breaketh down, and it is not built up, He shutteth against a man, And it is not opened.  
015 Lo, He keepeth in the waters, and they are dried up, And he sendeth them forth, And they overturn the land.  
016 With Him `are' strength and wisdom, His the deceived and deceiver. 
017 Causing counsellors to go away a spoil, And judges He maketh foolish.  
018 The bands of kings He hath opened, And He bindeth a girdle on their loins.  
019 Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth.  
020 Turning aside the lip of the stedfast, And the reason of the aged He taketh away.  
021 Pouring contempt upon princes, And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble.  
022 Removing deep things out of darkness, And He bringeth out to light death-shade.  
023 Magnifying the nations, and He destroyeth them, Spreading out the nations, and He quieteth them.  
024 Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land, And he causeth them to wander In vacancy -- no way!  
025 They feel darkness, and not light, He causeth them to wander as a drunkard.
