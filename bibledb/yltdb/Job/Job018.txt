001 And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --  
002 When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.  
003 Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!  
004 (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?  
005 Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.  
006 The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.  
007 Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.  
008 For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.  
009 Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.  
010 Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.  
011 Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him -- at his feet.  
012 Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.  
013 It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born.  
014 Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.  
015 It dwelleth in his tent -- out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.  
016 From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.  
017 His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.  
018 They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.  
019 He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.  
020 At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.  
021 Only these `are' tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.
