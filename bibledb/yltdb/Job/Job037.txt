001 Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place.  
002 Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth.  
003 Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light `is' over the skirts of the earth. 
004 After it roar doth a voice -- He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard.  
005 God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not.  
006 For to snow He saith, `Be `on' the earth.' And the small rain and great rain of His power. 
007 Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work.  
008 And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue.  
009 From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds -- cold,  
010 From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,  
011 Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light.  
012 And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth.  
013 Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness -- He doth cause it to come.  
014 Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.  
015 Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?  
016 Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?  
017 How thy garments `are' warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south? 
018 Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds -- strong as a hard mirror!  
019 Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness.  
020 Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up.  
021 And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it `is' in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them. 
022 From the golden north it cometh, Beside God `is' fearful honour. 
023 The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,  
024 Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart.
