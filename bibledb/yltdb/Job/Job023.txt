001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 Also -- to-day `is' my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing. 
003 O that I had known -- and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,  
004 I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill `with' arguments. 
005 I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.  
006 In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth `it' in me. 
007 There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.  
008 Lo, forward I go -- and He is not, And backward -- and I perceive him not.  
009 `To' the left in His working -- and I see not, He is covered `on' the right, and I behold not. 
010 For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me -- as gold I go forth.  
011 On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,  
012 The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.  
013 And He `is' in one `mind', And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired -- and He doth `it'. 
014 For He doth complete my portion, And many such things `are' with Him. 
015 Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.  
016 And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.  
017 For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.
