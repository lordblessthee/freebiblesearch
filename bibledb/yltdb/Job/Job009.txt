001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 Truly I have known that `it is' so, And what -- is man righteous with God? 
003 If he delight to strive with Him -- He doth not answer him one of a thousand.  
004 Wise in heart and strong in power -- Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?  
005 Who is removing mountains, And they have not known, Who hath overturned them in His anger.  
006 Who is shaking earth from its place, And its pillars move themselves.  
007 Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars He sealeth up.  
008 Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the heights of the sea,  
009 Making Osh, Kesil, and Kimah, And the inner chambers of the south.  
010 Doing great things till there is no searching, And wonderful, till there is no numbering.  
011 Lo, He goeth over by me, and I see not, And He passeth on, and I attend not to it.  
012 Lo, He snatches away, who bringeth it back? Who saith unto Him, `What dost Thou?'  
013 God doth not turn back His anger, Under Him bowed have proud helpers.  
014 How much less do I -- I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?  
015 Whom, though I were righteous, I answer not, For my judgment I make supplication.  
016 Though I had called and He answereth me, I do not believe that He giveth ear `to' my voice. 
017 Because with a tempest He bruiseth me, And hath multiplied my wounds for nought.  
018 He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit, But filleth me with bitter things.  
019 If of power, lo, the Strong One; And if of judgment -- who doth convene me?  
020 If I be righteous, Mine mouth doth declare me wicked, Perfect I am! -- it declareth me perverse.  
021 Perfect I am! -- I know not my soul, I despise my life.  
022 It is the same thing, therefore I said, `The perfect and the wicked He is consuming.'  
023 If a scourge doth put to death suddenly, At the trial of the innocent He laugheth.  
024 Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth, If not -- where, who `is' he? 
025 My days have been swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have not seen good,  
026 They have passed on with ships of reed, As an eagle darteth on food.  
027 Though I say, `I forget my talking, I forsake my corner, and I brighten up!'  
028 I have been afraid of all my griefs, I have known that Thou dost not acquit me.  
029 I -- I am become wicked; why `is' this? `In' vain I labour. 
030 If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with soap my hands,  
031 Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have abominated me.  
032 But if a man like myself -- I answer him, We come together into judgment.  
033 If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand on us both.  
034 He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth not make me afraid, 
035 I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with myself.
