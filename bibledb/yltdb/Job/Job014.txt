001 Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!  
002 As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.  
003 Also -- on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee.  
004 Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.  
005 If determined are his days, The number of his months `are' with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over; 
006 Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day.  
007 For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease.  
008 If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,  
009 From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant.  
010 And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where `is' he? 
011 Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry.  
012 And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep.  
013 O that in Sheol Thou wouldst conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me.  
014 If a man dieth -- doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.  
015 Thou dost call, and I -- I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire.  
016 But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin.  
017 Sealed up in a bag `is' my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity. 
018 And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place.  
019 Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed.  
020 Thou prevailest `over' him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away. 
021 Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them.  
022 Only -- his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.'
