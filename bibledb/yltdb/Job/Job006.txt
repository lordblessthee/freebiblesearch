001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed, And my calamity in balances They would lift up together!  
003 For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore my words have been rash.  
004 For arrows of the Mighty `are' with me, Whose poison is drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves `for' me! 
005 Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his provender?  
006 Eaten is an insipid thing without salt? Is there sense in the drivel of dreams?  
007 My soul is refusing to touch! They `are' as my sickening food. 
008 O that my request may come, That God may grant my hope!  
009 That God would please -- and bruise me, Loose His hand and cut me off!  
010 And yet it is my comfort, (And I exult in pain -- He doth not spare,) That I have not hidden The sayings of the Holy One.  
011 What `is' my power that I should hope? And what mine end That I should prolong my life? 
012 Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh brazen?  
013 Is not my help with me, And substance driven from me?  
014 To a despiser of his friends `is' shame, And the fear of the Mighty he forsaketh. 
015 My brethren have deceived as a brook, As a stream of brooks they pass away.  
016 That are black because of ice, By them doth snow hide itself.  
017 By the time they are warm they have been cut off, By its being hot they have been Extinguished from their place.  
018 Turn aside do the paths of their way, They ascend into emptiness, and are lost.  
019 Passengers of Tema looked expectingly, Travellers of Sheba hoped for them.  
020 They were ashamed that one hath trusted, They have come unto it and are confounded.  
021 Surely now ye have become the same! Ye see a downfall, and are afraid.  
022 Is it because I said, Give to me? And, By your power bribe for me?  
023 And, Deliver me from the hand of an adversary? And, From the hand of terrible ones ransom me?  
024 Shew me, and I -- I keep silent, And what I have erred, let me understand.  
025 How powerful have been upright sayings, And what doth reproof from you reprove?  
026 For reproof -- do you reckon words? And for wind -- sayings of the desperate.  
027 Anger on the fatherless ye cause to fall, And are strange to your friend.  
028 And, now, please, look upon me, Even to your face do I lie?  
029 Turn back, I pray you, let it not be perverseness, Yea, turn back again -- my righteousness `is' in it. 
030 Is there in my tongue perverseness? Discerneth not my palate desirable things?
