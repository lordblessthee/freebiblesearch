001 And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --  
002 Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?  
003 Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!  
004 And thou sayest, `Pure `is' my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.' 
005 And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.  
006 And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, `Some' of thine iniquity. 
007 By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?  
008 Heights of the heavens! -- what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! -- what knowest thou?  
009 Longer than earth `is' its measure, And broader than the sea. 
010 If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?  
011 For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider `it'! 
012 And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.  
013 If thou -- thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,  
014 If iniquity `is' in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents. 
015 For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.  
016 For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.  
017 And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest -- as the morning thou art.  
018 And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched -- in confidence thou liest down,  
019 And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;  
020 And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope `is' a breathing out of soul!
