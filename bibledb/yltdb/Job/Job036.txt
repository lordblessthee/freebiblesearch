001 And Elihu addeth and saith: --  
002 Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God `are' words. 
003 I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness.  
004 For, truly, my words `are' not false, The perfect in knowledge `is' with thee. 
005 Lo, God `is' mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty `in' power `and' heart. 
006 He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;  
007 He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And `from' kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high, 
008 And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,  
009 Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,  
010 And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity.  
011 If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness.  
012 And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge.  
013 And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them.  
014 Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled.  
015 He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear.  
016 And also He moved thee from a strait place, `To' a broad place -- no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness. 
017 And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld -- because of fury,  
018 Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside.  
019 Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power.  
020 Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead.  
021 Take heed -- do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than `on' affliction. 
022 Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who `is' like Him -- a teacher? 
023 Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, `Thou hast done iniquity?'  
024 Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.  
025 All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar.  
026 Lo, God `is' high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there `is' no searching. 
027 When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,  
028 Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly.  
029 Yea, doth `any' understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle? 
030 Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,  
031 For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance.  
032 By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,  
033 He sheweth by it `to' his friend substance, Anger against perversity.
