001 And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --  
002 Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?  
003 Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.  
004 The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.  
005 But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.  
006 Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the perfection of thy ways?  
007 Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?  
008 As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!  
009 From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.  
010 The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.  
011 An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.  
012 And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.  
013 In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,  
014 Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.  
015 And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;  
016 It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude `is' over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear: 
017 `Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?  
018 Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'  
019 Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation `is' in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.) 
020 From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.  
021 Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!
