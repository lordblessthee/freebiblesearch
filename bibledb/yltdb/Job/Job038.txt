001 And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: -- 
002 Who `is' this -- darkening counsel, By words without knowledge? 
003 Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.  
004 Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.  
005 Who placed its measures -- if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?  
006 On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?  
007 In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,  
008 And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.  
009 In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,  
010 And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,  
011 And say, `Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.'  
012 Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?  
013 To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,  
014 It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.  
015 And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.  
016 Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?  
017 Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?  
018 Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare -- if thou hast known it all.  
019 Where `is' this -- the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where `is' this -- its place? 
020 That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.  
021 Thou hast known -- for then thou art born And the number of thy days `are' many! 
022 Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?  
023 That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.  
024 Where `is' this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth. 
025 Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?  
026 To cause `it' to rain on a land -- no man, A wilderness -- no man in it. 
027 To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?  
028 Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?  
029 From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?  
030 As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.  
031 Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?  
032 Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?  
033 Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?  
034 Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?  
035 Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, `Behold us?'  
036 Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?  
037 Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,  
038 In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?  
039 Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?  
040 When they bow down in dens -- Abide in a thicket for a covert?  
041 Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.
