001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 What -- thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!  
003 What -- thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.  
004 With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?  
005 The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.  
006 Naked `is' Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction. 
007 Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,  
008 Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.  
009 Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.  
010 A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.  
011 Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.  
012 By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.  
013 By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.  
014 Lo, these `are' the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?
