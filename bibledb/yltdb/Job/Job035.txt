001 And Elihu answereth and saith: --  
002 This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said -- `My righteousness `is' more than God's?' 
003 For thou sayest, `What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?'  
004 I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,  
005 Behold attentively the heavens -- and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou.  
006 If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?  
007 If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?  
008 For a man like thyself `is' thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness. 
009 Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.  
010 And none said, `Where `is' God my maker? Giving songs in the night, 
011 Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.'  
012 There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers.  
013 Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it.  
014 Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment `is' before Him, and stay for Him. 
015 And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.  
016 And Job `with' vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth.
