001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters `are' ye all. 
003 Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?  
004 I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul's stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head.  
005 I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing.  
006 If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease -- what goeth from me?  
007 Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,  
008 And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.  
009 His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.  
010 They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves.  
011 God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over.  
012 At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark.  
013 Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.  
014 He breaketh me -- breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one.  
015 Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn.  
016 My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids `is' death-shade. 
017 Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer `is' pure. 
018 O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry.  
019 Also, now, lo, in the heavens `is' my witness, And my testifier in the high places. 
020 My interpreter `is' my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped: 
021 And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend.  
022 When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go.
