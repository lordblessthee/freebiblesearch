001 Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?  
002 For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,  
003 I -- I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,  
004 Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer.  
005 Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.  
006 For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery.  
007 For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.  
008 Yet I -- I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,  
009 Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering.  
010 Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places.  
011 To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high `in' safety. 
012 Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.  
013 Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,  
014 By day they meet darkness, And as night -- they grope at noon.  
015 And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,  
016 And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth.  
017 Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,  
018 For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal.  
019 In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee.  
020 In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword.  
021 When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh.  
022 At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid.  
023 (For with sons of the field `is' thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.) 
024 And thou hast known that thy tent `is' peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not, 
025 And hast known that numerous `is' Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth; 
026 Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season.  
027 Lo, this -- we searched it out -- it `is' right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!
