001 And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --  
002 Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind -- sayings of thy mouth?  
003 Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?  
004 If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,  
005 If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,  
006 If pure and upright thou `art', Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness. 
007 And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great.  
008 For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,  
009 (For of yesterday we `are', and we know not, For a shadow `are' our days on earth.) 
010 Do they not shew thee -- speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?  
011 `Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?  
012 While it `is' in its budding -- uncropt, Even before any herb it withereth. 
013 So `are' the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish, 
014 Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust.  
015 He leaneth on his house -- and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it -- and it abideth not.  
016 Green he `is' before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out. 
017 By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for.  
018 If `one' doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee! 
019 Lo, this `is' the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.' 
020 Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers.  
021 While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,  
022 Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!
