001 And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --  
002 Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me.  
003 The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:  
004 This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?  
005 That the singing of the wicked `is' short, And the joy of the profane for a moment, 
006 Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike --  
007 As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: `Where `is' he?' 
008 As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,  
009 The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him.  
010 His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth.  
011 His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down.  
012 Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,  
013 Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,  
014 His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps `is' in his heart. 
015 Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out.  
016 Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper.  
017 He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter.  
018 He is giving back `what' he laboured for, And doth not consume `it'; As a bulwark `is' his exchange, and he exults not. 
019 For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it.  
020 For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.  
021 There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay.  
022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.  
023 It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating.  
024 He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass.  
025 One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him `are' terrors. 
026 All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.  
027 Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him.  
028 Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger.  
029 This `is' the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.
