001 My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished -- graves `are' for me. 
002 If not -- mockeries `are' with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth. 
003 Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?  
004 For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.  
005 For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.  
006 And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.  
007 And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.  
008 Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.  
009 And the righteous layeth hold `on' his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And -- dumb are they all. 
010 Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.  
011 My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!  
012 Night for day they appoint, Light `is' near because of darkness. 
013 If I wait -- Sheol `is' my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch. 
014 To corruption I have called: -- `Thou `art' my father.' `My mother' and `my sister' -- to the worm. 
015 And where `is' now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it? 
016 `To' the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.
