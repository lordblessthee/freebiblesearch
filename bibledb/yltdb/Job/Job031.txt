001 A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what -- do I attend to a virgin?  
002 And what `is' the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights? 
003 Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?  
004 Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?  
005 If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,  
006 He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity.  
007 If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,  
008 Let me sow -- and another eat, And my products let be rooted out.  
009 If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,  
010 Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend.  
011 For it `is' a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity; 
012 For a fire it `is', to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root, 
013 If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,  
014 Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?  
015 Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One.  
016 If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,  
017 And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it,  
018 (But from my youth He grew up with me as `with' a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.) 
019 If I see `any' perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy, 
020 If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,  
021 If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in `him' the gate of my court, 
022 My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken.  
023 For a dread unto me `is' calamity `from' God, And because of His excellency I am not able. 
024 If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, `My trust,'  
025 If I rejoice because great `is' my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found, 
026 If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,  
027 And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,  
028 It also `is' a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above. 
029 If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,  
030 Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life.  
031 If not -- say ye, O men of my tent, `O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.'  
032 In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open.  
033 If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,  
034 Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening.  
035 Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written.  
036 If not -- on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself.  
037 The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him.  
038 If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,  
039 If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,  
040 Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished.
