001 And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --  
002 The rule and fear `are' with Him, Making peace in His high places. 
003 Is their `any' number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light? 
004 And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure -- born of a woman?  
005 Lo -- unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.  
006 How much less man -- a grub, And the son of man -- a worm!
