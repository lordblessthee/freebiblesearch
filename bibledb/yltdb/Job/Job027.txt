001 And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --  
002 God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty -- He made my soul bitter.  
003 For all the while my breath `is' in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils. 
004 My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit.  
005 Pollution to me -- if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me.  
006 On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.  
007 As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse.  
008 For what `is' the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul? 
009 His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?  
010 On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?  
011 I shew you by the hand of God, That which `is' with the Mighty I hide not. 
012 Lo, ye -- all of you -- have seen, And why `is' this -- ye are altogether vain? 
013 This `is' the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive. 
014 If his sons multiply -- for them `is' a sword. And his offspring `are' not satisfied `with' bread. 
015 His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep.  
016 If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,  
017 He prepareth -- and the righteous putteth `it' on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion. 
018 He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made.  
019 Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not.  
020 Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind.  
021 Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,  
022 And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth.  
023 It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place.
