001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation.  
003 Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking -- ye may deride.  
004 I -- to man `is' my complaint? and if `so', wherefore May not my temper become short? 
005 Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth.  
006 Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh hath taken fright.  
007 Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea, they have been mighty in wealth.  
008 Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And their offspring before their eyes.  
009 Their houses `are' peace without fear, Nor `is' a rod of God upon them. 
010 His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry.  
011 They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their children skip,  
012 They lift `themselves' up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of an organ. 
013 They wear out in good their days, And in a moment `to' Sheol go down. 
014 And they say to God, `Turn aside from us, And the knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired.  
015 What `is' the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?' 
016 Lo, not in their hand `is' their good, (The counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.) 
017 How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His anger.  
018 They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane hath stolen away,  
019 God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth recompense unto him -- and he knoweth.  
020 His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the Mighty he drinketh.  
021 For what `is' his delight in his house after him, And the number of his months cut off? 
022 To God doth `one' teach knowledge, And He the high doth judge? 
023 This `one' dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease and quiet. 
024 His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones doth moisten. 
025 And this `one' dieth with a bitter soul, And have not eaten with gladness. 
026 Together -- on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth cover them over.  
027 Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me ye do wrongfully.  
028 For ye say, `Where `is' the house of the noble? And where the tent -- The tabernacles of the wicked?' 
029 Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?  
030 That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought.  
031 Who doth declare to his face his way? And `for' that which he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him? 
032 And he -- to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.  
033 Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering.  
034 And how do ye comfort me `with' vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?
