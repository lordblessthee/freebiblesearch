001 And Job answereth and saith: --  
002 Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?  
003 These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make yourselves strange to me --  
004 And also -- truly, I have erred, With me doth my error remain.  
005 If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide against me my reproach;  
006 Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net against me hath set round,  
007 Lo, I cry out -- violence, and am not answered, I cry aloud, and there is no judgment.  
008 My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths darkness He placeth.  
009 Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth the crown from my head.  
010 He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth like a tree my hope.  
011 And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to Him as His adversaries.  
012 Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against me their way, And encamp round about my tent.  
013 My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me.  
014 Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me,  
015 Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon me: An alien I have been in their eyes.  
016 To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With my mouth I make supplication to him.  
017 My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the sons of my `mother's' womb. 
018 Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak against me.  
019 Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I have loved, Have been turned against me.  
020 To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I deliver myself with the skin of my teeth.  
021 Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath stricken against me.  
022 Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?  
023 Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth grant that in a book they may be graven?  
024 With a pen of iron and lead -- For ever in a rock they may be hewn.  
025 That -- I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last, For the dust he doth rise.  
026 And after my skin hath compassed this `body', Then from my flesh I see God: 
027 Whom I -- I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom.  
028 But ye say, `Why do we pursue after him?' And the root of the matter hath been found in me.  
029 Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious `are' the punishments of the sword, That ye may know that `there is' a judgment.
