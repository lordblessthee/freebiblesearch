001 Bowed down hath Bel, stooping is Nebo, Their idols have been for the beast and for cattle, Your burdens are loaded, a burden to the weary.  
002 They have stooped, they have bowed together, They have not been able to deliver the burden, And themselves into captivity have gone.  
003 Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of Israel, Who are borne from the belly, Who are carried from the womb,  
004 Even to old age I `am' He, and to grey hairs I carry, I made, and I bear, yea, I carry and deliver. 
005 To whom do ye liken Me, and make equal? And compare Me, that we may be like?  
006 -- They are pouring out gold from a bag, And silver on the beam they weigh, They hire a refiner, and he maketh it a god, They fall down, yea, they bow themselves.  
007 They lift him up on the shoulder, They carry him, and cause him to rest in his place, And he standeth, from his place he moveth not, Yea, one crieth unto him, and he answereth not, From his adversity he saveth him not.  
008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men, Turn `it' back, O transgressors, to the heart. 
009 Remember former things of old, For I `am' Mighty, and there is none else, God -- and there is none like Me. 
010 Declaring from the beginning the latter end, And from of old that which hath not been done, Saying, `My counsel doth stand, And all My delight I do.'  
011 Calling from the east a ravenous bird, From a far land the man of My counsel, Yea, I have spoken, yea, I bring it in, I have formed `it', yea, I do it. 
012 Hearken unto Me, ye mighty in heart, Who are far from righteousness.  
013 I have brought near My righteousness, It is not far off, And My salvation -- it doth not tarry, And I have given in Zion salvation, To Israel My glory!
