001 And these `are' births of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and born to them are sons after the deluge. 
002 `Sons of Japheth `are' Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
003 And sons of Gomer `are' Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
004 And sons of Javan `are' Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
005 By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations.  
006 And sons of Ham `are' Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 
007 And sons of Cush `are' Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah `are' Sheba and Dedan. 
008 And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;  
009 he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, `As Nimrod the hero `in' hunting before Jehovah.' 
010 And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;  
011 from that land he hath gone out to Asshur, and buildeth Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,  
012 and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it `is' the great city. 
013 And Mitzraim hath begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,  
014 and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, (whence have come out Philistim,) and the Caphtorim.  
015 And Canaan hath begotten Sidon his first-born, and Heth,  
016 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,  
017 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,  
018 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered.  
019 And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, `in' thy coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; `in' thy coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha. 
020 These `are' sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. 
021 As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he hath also begotten:  
022 Sons of Shem `are' Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 
023 And sons of Aram `are' Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
024 And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah, and Salah hath begotten Eber.  
025 And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one `is' Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided,) and his brother's name `is' Joktan. 
026 And Joktan hath begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,  
027 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,  
028 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,  
029 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these `are' sons of Joktan; 
030 and their dwelling is from Mesha, `in' thy coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east. 
031 These `are' sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations. 
032 These `are' families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge.
