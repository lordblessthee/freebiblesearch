001 Rivulets of waters `is' the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it. 
002 Every way of a man `is' right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts. 
003 To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.  
004 Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked `is' sin. 
005 The purposes of the diligent `are' only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want. 
006 The making of treasures by a lying tongue, `Is' a vanity driven away of those seeking death. 
007 The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.  
008 Froward `is' the way of a man who is vile, And the pure -- upright `is' his work. 
009 Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than `with' a woman of contentions and a house of company. 
010 The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.  
011 When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.  
012 The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.  
013 Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.  
014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.  
015 To do justice `is' joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity. 
016 A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.  
017 Whoso `is' loving mirth `is' a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth. 
018 The wicked `is' an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer. 
019 Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than `with' a woman of contentions and anger. 
020 A treasure to be desired, and oil, `Is' in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up. 
021 Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.  
022 A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.  
023 Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.  
024 Proud, haughty, scorner `is' his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride. 
025 The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.  
026 All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.  
027 The sacrifice of the wicked `is' abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it. 
028 A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.  
029 A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright -- he prepareth his way.  
030 There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.  
031 A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance `is' of Jehovah!
