001 My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,  
002 Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,  
003 Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,  
004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,  
005 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.  
006 Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;  
007 Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,  
008 She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.  
009 Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?  
010 A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,  
011 And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.  
012 A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking `with' perverseness of mouth, 
013 Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,  
014 Frowardness `is' in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth. 
015 Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.  
016 These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven `are' abominations to His soul. 
017 Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --  
018 A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --  
019 A false witness `who' doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren. 
020 Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.  
021 Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.  
022 In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh `with' thee. 
023 For a lamp `is' the command, And the law a light, And a way of life `are' reproofs of instruction, 
024 To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  
025 Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.  
026 For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.  
027 Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?  
028 Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?  
029 So `is' he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent. 
030 They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,  
031 And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.  
032 He who committeth adultery `with' a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it. 
033 A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,  
034 For jealousy `is' the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance. 
035 He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!
