001 My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,  
002 For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.  
003 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,  
004 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.  
005 Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.  
006 In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.  
007 Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.  
008 Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.  
009 Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;  
010 And filled are thy barns `with' plenty, And `with' new wine thy presses break forth. 
011 Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,  
012 For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.  
013 O the happiness of a man `who' hath found wisdom, And of a man `who' bringeth forth understanding. 
014 For better `is' her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold -- her increase. 
015 Precious she `is' above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her. 
016 Length of days `is' in her right hand, In her left `are' wealth and honour. 
017 Her ways `are' ways of pleasantness, And all her paths `are' peace. 
018 A tree of life she `is' to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her `is' happy. 
019 Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.  
020 By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.  
021 My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,  
022 And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.  
023 Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.  
024 If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.  
025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.  
026 For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.  
027 Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand `is' toward God to do `it'. 
028 Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.  
029 Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.  
030 Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.  
031 Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways. 
032 For an abomination to Jehovah `is' the perverted, And with the upright `is' His secret counsel. 
033 The curse of Jehovah `is' in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth. 
034 If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.  
035 Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
