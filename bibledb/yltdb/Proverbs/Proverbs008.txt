001 Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?  
002 At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,  
003 At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,  
004 `Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice `is' unto the sons of men. 
005 Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,  
006 Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips `is' uprightness. 
007 For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips `is' wickedness. 
008 In righteousness `are' all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse. 
009 All of them `are' plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge. 
010 Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.  
011 For better `is' wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it. 
012 I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.  
013 The fear of Jehovah `is' to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated. 
014 Mine `is' counsel and substance, I `am' understanding, I have might. 
015 By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,  
016 By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.  
017 I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.  
018 Wealth and honour `are' with me, Lasting substance and righteousness. 
019 Better `is' my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver. 
020 In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,  
021 To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.  
022 Jehovah possessed me -- the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.  
023 From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.  
024 In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy `with' waters, 
025 Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.  
026 While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.  
027 In His preparing the heavens I `am' there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep, 
028 In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,  
029 In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,  
030 Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight -- day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,  
031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights `are' with the sons of men. 
032 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.  
033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.  
034 O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.  
035 For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.  
036 And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
