001 Be not envious of evil men, And desire not to be with them.  
002 For destruction doth their heart meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.  
003 By wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding it establisheth itself.  
004 And by knowledge the inner parts are filled, `With' all precious and pleasant wealth. 
005 Mighty `is' the wise in strength, And a man of knowledge is strengthening power, 
006 For by plans thou makest for thyself war, And deliverance `is' in a multitude of counsellors. 
007 Wisdom `is' high for a fool, In the gate he openeth not his mouth. 
008 Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they call a master of wicked thoughts.  
009 The thought of folly `is' sin, And an abomination to man `is' a scorner. 
010 Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day of adversity, Straitened is thy power,  
011 If `from' delivering those taken to death, And those slipping to the slaughter -- thou keepest back. 
012 When thou sayest, `Lo, we knew not this.' Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the Keeper of thy soul He who knoweth? And He hath rendered to man according to his work.  
013 Eat my son, honey that `is' good, And the honeycomb -- sweet to thy palate. 
014 So `is' the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul, If thou hast found that there is a posterity And thy hope is not cut off. 
015 Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.  
016 For seven `times' doth the righteous fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil. 
017 In the falling of thine enemy rejoice not, And in his stumbling let not thy heart be joyful,  
018 Lest Jehovah see, and `it be' evil in His eyes, And He hath turned from off him His anger. 
019 Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not envious at the wicked,  
020 For there is not a posterity to the evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.  
021 Fear Jehovah, my son, and the king, With changers mix not up thyself,  
022 For suddenly doth their calamity rise, And the ruin of them both -- who knoweth!  
023 These also are for the wise: -- To discern faces in judgment is not good.  
024 Whoso is saying to the wicked, `Thou `art' righteous,' Peoples execrate him -- nations abhor him. 
025 And to those reproving it is pleasant, And on them cometh a good blessing.  
026 Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words.  
027 Prepare in an out-place thy work, And make it ready in the field -- go afterwards, Then thou hast built thy house.  
028 Be not a witness for nought against thy neighbour, Or thou hast enticed with thy lips.  
029 Say not, `As he did to me, so I do to him, I render to each according to his work.'  
030 Near the field of a slothful man I passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.  
031 And lo, it hath gone up -- all of it -- thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall hath been broken down.  
032 And I see -- I -- I do set my heart, I have seen -- I have received instruction,  
033 A little sleep -- a little slumber -- A little folding of the hands to lie down.  
034 And thy poverty hath come `as' a traveller, And thy want as an armed man!
