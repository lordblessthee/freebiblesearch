001 For `an object of' desire he who is separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth. 
002 A fool delighteth not in understanding, But -- in uncovering his heart.  
003 With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt, And with shame -- reproach.  
004 Deep waters `are' the words of a man's mouth, The fountain of wisdom `is' a flowing brook. 
005 Acceptance of the face of the wicked `is' not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment. 
006 The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes calleth.  
007 The mouth of a fool `is' ruin to him, And his lips `are' the snare of his soul. 
008 The words of a tale-bearer `are' as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down `to' the inner parts of the heart. 
009 He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he `is' to a destroyer. 
010 A tower of strength `is' the name of Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high. 
011 The wealth of the rich `is' the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination. 
012 Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour `is' humility. 
013 Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.  
014 The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?  
015 The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  
016 The gift of a man maketh room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.  
017 Righteous `is' the first in his own cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him. 
018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separateth.  
019 A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.  
020 From the fruit of a man's mouth is his belly satisfied, `From the' increase of his lips he is satisfied. 
021 Death and life `are' in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit. 
022 `Whoso' hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah. 
023 `With' supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things. 
024 A man with friends `is' to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
