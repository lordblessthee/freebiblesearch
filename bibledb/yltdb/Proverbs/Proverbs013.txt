001 A wise son -- the instruction of a father, And a scorner -- he hath not heard rebuke.  
002 From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous -- violence.  
003 Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips -- ruin to him!  
004 The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.  
005 A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.  
006 Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.  
007 There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth `is' abundant. 
008 The ransom of a man's life `are' his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke. 
009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.  
010 A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled `is' wisdom. 
011 Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.  
012 Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life `is' the coming desire. 
013 Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.  
014 The law of the wise `is' a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death. 
015 Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous `is' hard. 
016 Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.  
017 A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.  
018 Whoso is refusing instruction -- poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.  
019 A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools `is': Turn from evil. 
020 Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.  
021 Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.  
022 A good man causeth sons' sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous `is' the sinner's wealth. 
023 Abundance of food -- the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.  
024 Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.  
025 The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!
