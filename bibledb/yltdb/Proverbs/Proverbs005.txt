001 My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,  
002 To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.  
003 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil `is' her mouth, 
004 And her latter end `is' bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword `with' mouths. 
005 Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.  
006 The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths -- thou knowest not.  
007 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.  
008 Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,  
009 Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,  
010 Lest strangers be filled `with' thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger, 
011 And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,  
012 And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,  
013 And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.  
014 As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.  
015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.  
016 Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.  
017 Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.  
018 Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,  
019 A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.  
020 And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?  
021 For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.  
022 His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.  
023 He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
