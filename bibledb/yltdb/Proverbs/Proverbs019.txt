001 Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse `in' his lips, who `is' a fool. 
002 Also, without knowledge the soul `is' not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning. 
003 The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Jehovah is his heart wroth.  
004 Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.  
005 A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.  
006 Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.  
007 All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words -- they are not!  
008 Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.  
009 A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.  
010 Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.  
011 The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory `is' to pass over transgression. 
012 The wrath of a king `is' a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will. 
013 A calamity to his father `is' a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife `are' a continual dropping. 
014 House and wealth `are' the inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah `is' an understanding wife. 
015 Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul doth hunger.  
016 Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.  
017 Whoso is lending `to' Jehovah is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him. 
018 Chastise thy son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.  
019 A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.  
020 Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that thou art wise in thy latter end.  
021 Many `are' the purposes in a man's heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth. 
022 The desirableness of a man `is' his kindness, And better `is' the poor than a liar. 
023 The fear of Jehovah `is' to life, And satisfied he remaineth -- he is not charged with evil. 
024 The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.  
025 A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.  
026 Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.  
027 Cease, my son, to hear instruction -- To err from sayings of knowledge.  
028 A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.  
029 Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!
