001 Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.  
002 Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.  
003 A stone `is' heavy, and the sand `is' heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both. 
004 Fury `is' fierce, and anger `is' overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy? 
005 Better `is' open reproof than hidden love. 
006 Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.  
007 A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And `to' a hungry soul every bitter thing `is' sweet. 
008 As a bird wandering from her nest, So `is' a man wandering from his place. 
009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend -- from counsel of the soul.  
010 Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better `is' a near neighbour than a brother afar off. 
011 Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.  
012 The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.  
013 Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.  
014 Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.  
015 A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,  
016 Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.  
017 Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.  
018 The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.  
019 As `in' water the face `is' to face, So the heart of man to man. 
020 Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.  
021 A refining pot `is' for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise. 
022 If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things -- with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.  
023 Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,  
024 For riches `are' not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation. 
025 Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.  
026 Lambs `are' for thy clothing, And the price of the field `are' he-goats, 
027 And a sufficiency of goats' milk `is' for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!
