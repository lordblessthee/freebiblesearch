001 Every wise woman hath builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.  
002 Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah, And the perverted `in' his ways is despising Him. 
003 In the mouth of a fool `is' a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them. 
004 Without oxen a stall `is' clean, And great `is' the increase by the power of the ox. 
005 A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.  
006 A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent `is' easy. 
007 Go from before a foolish man, Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge.  
008 The wisdom of the prudent `is' to understand his way, And the folly of fools `is' deceit. 
009 Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright -- a pleasing thing.  
010 The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.  
011 The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.  
012 There is a way -- right before a man, And its latter end `are' ways of death. 
013 Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy `is' affliction. 
014 From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man -- from his fruits.  
015 The simple giveth credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.  
016 The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.  
017 Whoso is short of temper doth folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.  
018 The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned `with' knowledge. 
019 The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  
020 Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich `are' many. 
021 Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.  
022 Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth `are' to those devising good, 
023 In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips `is' only to want. 
024 The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools `is' folly. 
025 A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.  
026 In the fear of Jehovah `is' strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge. 
027 The fear of Jehovah `is' a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death. 
028 In the multitude of a people `is' the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince. 
029 Whoso is slow to anger `is' of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly. 
030 A healed heart `is' life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones `is' envy. 
031 An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.  
032 In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death `is' the righteous. 
033 In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.  
034 Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples `is' a sin-offering. 
035 The favour of a king `is' to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!
