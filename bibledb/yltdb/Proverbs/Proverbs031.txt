001 Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:  
002 `What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?  
003 Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away of kings.  
004 Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.  
005 Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.  
006 Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,  
007 He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembereth not again.  
008 Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.  
009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!'  
010 A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies `is' her price. 
011 The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.  
012 She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.  
013 She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh `with' her hands. 
014 She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she bringeth in her bread.  
015 Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.  
016 She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.  
017 She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen her arms.  
018 She hath perceived when her merchandise `is' good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night. 
019 Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.  
020 Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.  
021 She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed `with' scarlet. 
022 Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and purple `are' her clothing. 
023 Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.  
024 Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.  
025 Strength and honour `are' her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day. 
026 Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness `is' on her tongue. 
027 She `is' watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not. 
028 Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,  
029 `Many `are' the daughters who have done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.' 
030 The grace `is' false, and the beauty `is' vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself. 
031 Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!
