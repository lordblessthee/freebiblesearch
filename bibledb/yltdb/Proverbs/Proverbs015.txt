001 A soft answer turneth back fury, And a grievous word raiseth up anger.  
002 The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.  
003 In every place are the eyes of Jehovah, Watching the evil and the good.  
004 A healed tongue `is' a tree of life, And perverseness in it -- a breach in the spirit. 
005 A fool despiseth the instruction of his father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.  
006 `In' the house of the righteous `is' abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked -- trouble. 
007 The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, And the heart of fools `is' not right. 
008 The sacrifice of the wicked `is' an abomination to Jehovah, And the prayer of the upright `is' His delight. 
009 An abomination to Jehovah `is' the way of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth. 
010 Chastisement `is' grievous to him who is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth. 
011 Sheol and destruction `are' before Jehovah, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men. 
012 A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto the wise he goeth not.  
013 A joyful heart maketh glad the face, And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.  
014 The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.  
015 All the days of the afflicted `are' evil, And gladness of heart `is' a perpetual banquet. 
016 Better `is' a little with the fear of Jehovah, Than much treasure, and tumult with it. 
017 Better `is' an allowance of green herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it. 
018 A man of fury stirreth up contention, And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.  
019 The way of the slothful `is' as a hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up. 
020 A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother.  
021 Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And a man of intelligence directeth `his' going. 
022 Without counsel `is' the making void of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established. 
023 Joy `is' to a man in the answer of his mouth, And a word in its season -- how good! 
024 A path of life `is' on high for the wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath. 
025 The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.  
026 An abomination to Jehovah `are' thoughts of wickedness, And pure `are' sayings of pleasantness. 
027 A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, And whoso is hating gifts liveth.  
028 The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.  
029 Far `is' Jehovah from the wicked, And the prayer of the righteous He heareth. 
030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, A good report maketh fat the bone.  
031 An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise.  
032 Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting understanding.  
033 The fear of Jehovah `is' the instruction of wisdom, And before honour `is' humility!
