001 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:  
002 For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,  
003 For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,  
004 For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion.  
005 (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)  
006 For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.  
007 Fear of Jehovah `is' a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised! 
008 Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,  
009 For a graceful wreath `are' they to thy head, And chains to thy neck. 
010 My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.  
011 If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,  
012 We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those going down `to' the pit, 
013 Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses `with' spoil, 
014 Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.'  
015 My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,  
016 For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.  
017 Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.  
018 And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.  
019 So `are' the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh. 
020 Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,  
021 At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:  
022 `Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?  
023 Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.  
024 Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,  
025 And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.  
026 I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,  
027 When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.  
028 Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.  
029 Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.  
030 They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,  
031 And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.  
032 For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.  
033 And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And `is' quiet from fear of evil!'
