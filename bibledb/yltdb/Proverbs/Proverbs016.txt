001 Of man `are' arrangements of the heart, And from Jehovah an answer of the tongue. 
002 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering the spirits.  
003 Roll unto Jehovah thy works, And established are thy purposes,  
004 All things hath Jehovah wrought for Himself, And also the wicked `worketh' for a day of evil. 
005 An abomination to Jehovah `is' every proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted. 
006 In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity, And in the fear of Jehovah Turn thou aside from evil.  
007 When a man's ways please Jehovah, even his enemies, He causeth to be at peace with him.  
008 Better `is' a little with righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice. 
009 The heart of man deviseth his way, And Jehovah establisheth his step. 
010 An oath `is' on the lips of a king, In judgment his mouth trespasseth not. 
011 A just beam and balances `are' Jehovah's, His work `are' all the stones of the bag. 
012 An abomination to kings `is' doing wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established. 
013 The delight of kings `are' righteous lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth, 
014 The fury of a king `is' messengers of death, And a wise man pacifieth it. 
015 In the light of a king's face `is' life, And his good-will `is' as a cloud of the latter rain. 
016 To get wisdom -- how much better than gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!  
017 A highway of the upright `is', `Turn from evil,' Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way. 
018 Before destruction `is' pride, And before stumbling -- a haughty spirit.' 
019 Better is humility of spirit with the poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.  
020 The wise in any matter findeth good, And whoso is trusting in Jehovah, O his happiness.  
021 To the wise in heart is called, `Intelligent,' And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.  
022 A fountain of life `is' understanding to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly. 
023 The heart of the wise causeth his mouth to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,  
024 Sayings of pleasantness `are' a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone. 
025 There is a way right before a man, And its latter end -- ways of death.  
026 A labouring man hath laboured for himself, For his mouth hath caused `him' to bend over it. 
027 A worthless man is preparing evil, And on his lips -- as a burning fire.  
028 A froward man sendeth forth contention, A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.  
029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, And hath causeth him to go in a way not good.  
030 Consulting his eyes to devise froward things, Moving his lips he hath accomplished evil.  
031 A crown of beauty `are' grey hairs, In the way of righteousness it is found. 
032 Better `is' the slow to anger than the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city. 
033 Into the centre is the lot cast, And from Jehovah `is' all its judgment!
