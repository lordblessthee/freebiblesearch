001 Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son `is' an affliction to his mother. 
002 Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.  
003 Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.  
004 Poor `is' he who is working -- a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 
005 Whoso is gathering in summer `is' a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest `is' a son causing shame. 
006 Blessings `are' for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence. 
007 The remembrance of the righteous `is' for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot. 
008 The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.  
009 Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.  
010 Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.  
011 A fountain of life `is' the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence. 
012 Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.  
013 In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod `is' for the back of him who is lacking understanding. 
014 The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool `is' near ruin. 
015 The wealth of the rich `is' his strong city, The ruin of the poor `is' their poverty. 
016 The wage of the righteous `is' for life, The increase of the wicked for sin. 
017 A traveller to life `is' he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring. 
018 Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.  
019 In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips `is' wise. 
020 The tongue of the righteous `is' chosen silver, The heart of the wicked -- as a little thing. 
021 The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.  
022 The blessing of Jehovah -- it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.  
023 To execute inventions `is' as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding. 
024 The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.  
025 As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.  
026 As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So `is' the slothful to those sending him. 
027 The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.  
028 The hope of the righteous `is' joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth. 
029 The way of Jehovah `is' strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity. 
030 The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.  
031 The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.  
032 The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
