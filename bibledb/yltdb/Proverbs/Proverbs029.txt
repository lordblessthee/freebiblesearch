001 A man often reproved, hardening the neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.  
002 In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.  
003 A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father, And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.  
004 A king by judgment establisheth a land, And one receiving gifts throweth it down.  
005 A man taking a portion above his neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.  
006 In the transgression of the evil `is' a snare, And the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
007 The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.  
008 Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the wise turn back anger.  
009 A wise man is judged by the foolish man, And he hath been angry, And he hath laughed, and there is no rest.  
010 Men of blood hate the perfect, And the upright seek his soul.  
011 A fool bringeth out all his mind, And the wise till afterwards restraineth it.  
012 A ruler who is attending to lying words, All his ministers `are' wicked. 
013 The poor and the man of frauds have met together, Jehovah is enlightening the eyes of them both.  
014 a king that is judging truly the poor, His throne for ever is established.  
015 A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a youth let away is shaming his mother.  
016 In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.  
017 Chastise thy son, and he giveth thee comfort, Yea, he giveth delights to thy soul.  
018 Without a Vision is a people made naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!  
019 By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, And there is nothing answering.  
020 Thou hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.  
021 Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, `At' his latter end also he is continuator. 
022 An angry man stirreth up contention, And a furious man is multiplying transgression.  
023 The pride of man humbleth him, And humility of spirit upholdeth honour.  
024 Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.  
025 Fear of man causeth a snare, And the confident in Jehovah is set on high.  
026 Many are seeking the face of a ruler, And from Jehovah `is' the judgment of each. 
027 An abomination to the righteous `is' the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked `is' the upright in the way!
