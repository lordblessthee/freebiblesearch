001 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.  
002 For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.  
003 For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only one before my mother.  
004 And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.  
005 Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.  
006 Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.  
007 The first thing `is' wisdom -- get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding. 
008 Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.  
009 She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.  
010 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life `are' multiplied to thee. 
011 In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.  
012 In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.  
013 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she `is' thy life. 
014 Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.  
015 Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.  
016 For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not `some' to stumble. 
017 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.  
018 And the path of the righteous `is' as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established, 
019 The way of the wicked `is' as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble. 
020 My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,  
021 Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.  
022 For life they `are' to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing. 
023 Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it `are' the outgoings of life. 
024 Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,  
025 Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.  
026 Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways `are' established. 
027 Incline not `to' the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!
