001 A name is chosen rather than much wealth, Than silver and than gold -- good grace.  
002 Rich and poor have met together, The Maker of them all `is' Jehovah. 
003 The prudent hath seen the evil, and is hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.  
004 The end of humility `is' the fear of Jehovah, Riches, and honour, and life. 
005 Thorns -- snares `are' in the way of the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them. 
006 Give instruction to a youth about his way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.  
007 The rich over the poor ruleth, And a servant `is' the borrower to the lender. 
008 Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.  
009 The good of eye -- he is blessed, For he hath given of his bread to the poor.  
010 Cast out a scorner -- and contention goeth out, And strife and shame cease.  
011 Whoso is loving cleanness of heart, Grace `are' his lips, a king `is' his friend. 
012 The eyes of Jehovah have kept knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.  
013 The slothful hath said, `A lion `is' without, In the midst of the broad places I am slain.' 
014 A deep pit `is' the mouth of strange women, The abhorred of Jehovah falleth there. 
015 Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.  
016 He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him, He is giving to the rich -- only to want.  
017 Incline thine ear, and hear words of the wise, And thy heart set to my knowledge,  
018 For they are pleasant when thou dost keep them in thy heart, They are prepared together for thy lips.  
019 That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know to-day, even thou.  
020 Have I not written to thee three times With counsels and knowledge?  
021 To cause thee to know the certainty of sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending thee.  
022 Rob not the poor because he `is' poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate. 
023 For Jehovah pleadeth their cause, And hath spoiled the soul of their spoilers.  
024 Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man, And with a man of fury go not in,  
025 Lest thou learn his paths, And have received a snare to thy soul.  
026 Be not thou among those striking hands, Among sureties `for' burdens. 
027 If thou hast nothing to pay, Why doth he take thy bed from under thee?  
028 Remove not a border of olden times, That thy fathers have made.  
029 Hast thou seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he doth station himself, He stations not himself before obscure men!
