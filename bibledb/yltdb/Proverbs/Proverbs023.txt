001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Thou considerest diligently that which `is' before thee, 
002 And thou hast put a knife to thy throat, If thou `art' a man of appetite. 
003 Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it `is' lying food. 
004 Labour not to make wealth, From thine own understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.  
005 For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.  
006 Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,  
007 For as he hath thought in his soul, so `is' he, `Eat and drink,' saith he to thee, And his heart `is' not with thee. 
008 Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up, And hast marred thy words that `are' sweet. 
009 In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.  
010 Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,  
011 For their Redeemer `is' strong, He doth plead their cause with thee. 
012 Bring in to instruction thy heart, And thine ear to sayings of knowledge.  
013 Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.  
014 Thou with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol thou deliverest.  
015 My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,  
016 And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly.  
017 Let not thy heart be envious at sinners, But -- in the fear of Jehovah all the day.  
018 For, is there a posterity? Then thy hope is not cut off.  
019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way thy heart,  
020 Be not thou among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,  
021 For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.  
022 Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.  
023 Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,  
024 The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.  
025 Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother, Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.  
026 Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let thine eyes watch my ways.  
027 For a harlot `is' a deep ditch, And a strange woman `is' a strait pit. 
028 She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.  
029 Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?  
030 Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.  
031 See not wine when it showeth itself red, When it giveth in the cup its colour, It goeth up and down through the upright.  
032 Its latter end -- as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.  
033 Thine eyes see strange women, And thy heart speaketh perverse things.  
034 And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.  
035 `They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake -- I seek it yet again!'
