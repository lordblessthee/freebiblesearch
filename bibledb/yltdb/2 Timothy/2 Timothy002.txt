001 Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that `is' in Christ Jesus, 
002 and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;  
003 thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;  
004 no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;  
005 and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;  
006 the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;  
007 be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.  
008 Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,  
009 in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;  
010 because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that `is' in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during. 
011 Stedfast `is' the word: For if we died together -- we also shall live together; 
012 if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny `him', he also shall deny us; 
013 if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.  
014 These things remind `them' of, testifying fully before the Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing; 
015 be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;  
016 and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,  
017 and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,  
018 who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;  
019 sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, `The Lord hath known those who are His,' and `Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ.'  
020 And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:  
021 if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared,  
022 and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;  
023 and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,  
024 and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,  
025 in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,  
026 and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.
