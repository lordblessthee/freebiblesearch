001 And it cometh to pass, in the thirtieth year, in the fourth `month', in the fifth of the month, and I `am' in the midst of the Removed by the river Chebar, the heavens have been opened, and I see visions of God. 
002 In the fifth of the month -- it is the fifth year of the removal of the king Jehoiachin --  
003 hath the word of Jehovah certainly been unto Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, and there is on him there a hand of Jehovah.  
004 And I look, and lo, a tempestuous wind is coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire catching itself, and brightness to it round about, and out of its midst as the colour of copper, out of the midst of the fire.  
005 And out of its midst `is' a likeness of four living creatures, and this `is' their appearance; a likeness of man `is' to them, 
006 and four faces `are' to each, and four wings `are' to each of them, 
007 and their feet `are' straight feet, and the sole of their feet `is' as a sole of a calf's foot, and they are sparkling as the colour of bright brass; 
008 and hands of man under their wings -- on their four sides, and their faces and their wings -- `are' to them four; 
009 joining one unto another `are' their wings, they turn not round in their going, each straight forward they go. 
010 As to the likeness of their faces, the face of a man, and the face of a lion, toward the right `are' to them four, and the face of an ox on the left `are' to them four, and the face of an eagle `are' to them four. 
011 And their faces and their wings are separate from above, to each `are' two joining together, and two are covering their bodies. 
012 And each straight forward they go, whither the spirit is to go, they go, they turn not round in their going.  
013 As to the likeness of the living creatures, their appearances `are' as coals of fire -- burning as the appearance of lamps; it is going up and down between the living creatures, and brightness `is' to the fire, and out of the fire is going forth lightning. 
014 And the living creatures are running, and turning back, as the appearance of the flash.  
015 And I see the living creatures, and lo, one wheel `is' in the earth, near the living creatures, at its four faces. 
016 The appearance of the wheels and their works `is' as the colour of beryl, and one likeness `is' to them four, and their appearances and their works `are' as it were the wheel in the midst of the wheel. 
017 On their four sides, in their going they go, they turn not round in their going.  
018 As to their rings, they are both high and fearful, and their rings `are' full of eyes round about them four. 
019 And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels go beside them, and in the living creatures being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels.  
020 Whither the spirit is to go, they go, thither the spirit `is' to go, and the wheels are lifted up over-against them, for a living spirit `is' in the wheels. 
021 In their going, they go; and in their standing, they stand; and in their being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels over-against them; for a living spirit `is' in the wheels. 
022 And a likeness `is' over the heads of the living creatures of an expanse, as the colour of the fearful ice, stretched out over their heads from above. 
023 And under the expanse their wings `are' straight, one toward the other, to each are two covering on this side, and to each are two covering on that side -- their bodies. 
024 And I hear the noise of their wings, as the noise of many waters, as the noise of the Mighty One, in their going -- the noise of tumult, as the noise of a camp, in their standing they let fall their wings.  
025 And there is a voice from above the expanse, that `is' above their head: in their standing they let fall their wings. 
026 And above the expanse that `is' over their head, as an appearance of a sapphire stone, `is' the likeness of a throne, and on the likeness of the throne a likeness, as the appearance of man upon it from above. 
027 And I see as the colour of copper, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I have seen as the appearance of fire, and brightness `is' to it round about. 
028 As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of rain, so `is' the appearance of the brightness round about.
