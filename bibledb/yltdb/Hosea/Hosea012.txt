001 Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried.  
002 And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He returneth to him.  
003 In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he was a prince with God,  
004 Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh `by' weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He doth find him, And there He doth speak with us, 
005 Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah `is' His memorial. 
006 And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment keep thou, And wait on thy God continually.  
007 Canaan! in his hand `are' balances of deceit! To oppress he hath loved. 
008 And Ephraim saith: `Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself, All my labours -- they find not against me iniquity that `is' sin.' 
009 And I -- Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed time.  
010 And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.  
011 Surely Gilead `is' iniquity, Only, vanity they have been, In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars `are' as heaps, on the furrows of a field. 
012 And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram, And Israel doth serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he hath kept watch.  
013 And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet it hath been watched.  
014 Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly, And his blood on himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him doth his Lord!
