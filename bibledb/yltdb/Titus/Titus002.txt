001 And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;  
002 aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;  
003 aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,  
004 that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of `their' husbands, lovers of `their' children, 
005 sober, pure, keepers of `their own' houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of. 
006 The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;  
007 concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,  
008 discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.  
009 Servants -- to their own masters `are' to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying, 
010 not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.  
011 For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,  
012 teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,  
013 waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,  
014 who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;  
015 these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
