001 And working together also we call upon `you' that ye receive not in vain the grace of God -- 
002 for He saith, `In an acceptable time I did hear thee, and in a day of salvation I did help thee, lo, now `is' a well-accepted time; lo, now, a day of salvation,' -- 
003 in nothing giving any cause of offence, that the ministration may be not blamed,  
004 but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministrants; in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,  
005 in stripes, in imprisonments, in insurrections, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,  
006 in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,  
007 in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the armour of the righteousness, on the right and on the left,  
008 through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as leading astray, and true;  
009 as unknown, and recognized; as dying, and lo, we live; as chastened, and not put to death;  
010 as sorrowful, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.  
011 Our mouth hath been open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart hath been enlarged!  
012 ye are not straitened in us, and ye are straitened in your `own' bowels, 
013 and `as' a recompense of the same kind, (as to children I say `it',) be ye enlarged -- also ye! 
014 Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers, for what partaking `is there' to righteousness and lawlessness? 
015 and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?  
016 and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God, according as God said -- `I will dwell in them, and will walk among `them', and I will be their God, and they shall be My people, 
017 wherefore, come ye forth out of the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and an unclean thing do not touch, and I -- I will receive you,  
018 and I will be to you for a Father, and ye -- ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.'
