001 Do we begin again to recommend ourselves, except we need, as some, letters of recommendation unto you, or from you?  
002 our letter ye are, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men,  
003 manifested that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart,  
004 and such trust we have through the Christ toward God,  
005 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency `is' of God, 
006 who also made us sufficient `to be' ministrants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; for the letter doth kill, and the spirit doth make alive. 
007 and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face -- which was being made useless,  
008 how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory?  
009 for if the ministration of the condemnation `is' glory, much more doth the ministration of the righteousness abound in glory; 
010 for also even that which hath been glorious, hath not been glorious -- in this respect, because of the superior glory;  
011 for if that which is being made useless `is' through glory, much more that which is remaining `is' in glory. 
012 Having, then, such hope, we use much freedom of speech,  
013 and `are' not as Moses, who was putting a vail upon his own face, for the sons of Israel not stedfastly to look to the end of that which is being made useless, 
014 but their minds were hardened, for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant doth remain unwithdrawn -- which in Christ is being made useless --  
015 but till to-day, when Moses is read, a vail upon their heart doth lie,  
016 and whenever they may turn unto the Lord, the vail is taken away.  
017 And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord `is', there `is' liberty; 
018 and we all, with unvailed face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
