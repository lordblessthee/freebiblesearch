001 And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --  
002 and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing --  
003 therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, `Sir, lo, he whom thou dost love is ailing;'  
004 and Jesus having heard, said, `This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.'  
005 And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,  
006 when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,  
007 then after this, he saith to the disciples, `We may go to Judea again;'  
008 the disciples say to him, `Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!'  
009 Jesus answered, `Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the light of this world he doth see;  
010 and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.'  
011 These things he said, and after this he saith to them, `Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;'  
012 therefore said his disciples, `Sir, if he hath fallen asleep, he will be saved;'  
013 but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.  
014 Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, `Lazarus hath died;  
015 and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;'  
016 therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, `We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,'  
017 Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.  
018 And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,  
019 and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;  
020 Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.  
021 Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;  
022 but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God, God will give to thee;'  
023 Jesus saith to her, `Thy brother shall rise again.'  
024 Martha saith to him, `I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'  
025 Jesus said to her, `I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;  
026 and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age;  
027 believest thou this?' she saith to him, `Yes, sir, I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'  
028 And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, `The Teacher is present, and doth call thee;'  
029 she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to him;  
030 and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;  
031 the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- `She doth go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'  
032 Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;'  
033 Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,  
034 `Where have ye laid him?' they say to him, `Sir, come and see;'  
035 Jesus wept.  
036 The Jews, therefore, said, `Lo, how he was loving him!'  
037 and certain of them said, `Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'  
038 Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,  
039 Jesus saith, `Take ye away the stone;' the sister of him who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him, `Sir, already he stinketh, for he is four days dead;'  
040 Jesus saith to her, `Said I not to thee, that if thou mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?'  
041 They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, `Father, I thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;  
042 and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I said `it', that they may believe that Thou didst send me.' 
043 And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, `Lazarus, come forth;'  
044 and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus saith to them, `Loose him, and suffer to go.'  
045 Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;  
046 but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;  
047 the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrim, and said, `What may we do? because this man doth many signs?  
048 if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'  
049 and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, `Ye have not known anything,  
050 nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'  
051 And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,  
052 and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.  
053 From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;  
054 Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.  
055 And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;  
056 they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, `What doth appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?'  
057 and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew `it', so that they may seize him.
