001 And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;  
002 with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,  
003 for yet ye are fleshly, for where `there is' among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk? 
004 for when one may say, `I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, `I -- of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?  
005 Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?  
006 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;  
007 so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;  
008 and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,  
009 for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building ye are.  
010 According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on `it', 
011 for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;  
012 and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --  
013 of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare `it', because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove; 
014 if of any one the work doth remain that he built on `it', a wage he shall receive; 
015 if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.  
016 have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?  
017 if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.  
018 Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,  
019 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, `Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'  
020 and again, `The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'  
021 So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,  
022 whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,  
023 and ye `are' Christ's, and Christ `is' God's.
