048 This `is' the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan, for their families, these cities and their villages. 
049 And they finish to give the land in inheritance, by its borders, and the sons of Israel give an inheritance to Joshua son of Nun in their midst;  
050 by the command of Jehovah they have given to him the city which he asked, Timnath-Serah, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and he buildeth the city and dwelleth in it.
