001 And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,  
002 who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;  
003 this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken `him', he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a Greek. 
004 And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who `are' in Jerusalem, 
005 then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;  
006 and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,  
007 having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,  
008 and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.  
009 And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, `Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --  
010 and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them,  
011 having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,  
012 thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,  
013 on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,  
014 and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;  
015 and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, `If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us.  
016 And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,  
017 she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, `These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'  
018 and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour.  
019 And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew `them' to the market-place, unto the rulers, 
020 and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, `These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;  
021 and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'  
022 And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat `them' with rods, 
023 many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,  
024 who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.  
025 And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,  
026 and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;  
027 and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,  
028 and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, `Thou mayest not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.'  
029 And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,  
030 and having brought them forth, said, `Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?'  
031 and they said, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved -- thou and thy house;'  
032 and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;  
033 and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe `them' from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently, 
034 having brought them also into his house, he set food before `them', and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God. 
035 And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, `Let those men go;'  
036 and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- `The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'  
037 and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast `us' to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.' 
038 And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,  
039 and having come, they besought them, and having brought `them' forth, they were asking `them' to go forth from the city; 
040 and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into `the house of' Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.
