001 The Song of Songs, that `is' Solomon's. 
002 Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, For better `are' thy loves than wine. 
003 For fragrance `are' thy perfumes good. Perfume emptied out -- thy name, Therefore have virgins loved thee! 
004 Draw me: after thee we run, The king hath brought me into his inner chambers, We do joy and rejoice in thee, We mention thy loves more than wine, Uprightly they have loved thee!  
005 Dark `am' I, and comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As tents of Kedar, as curtains of Solomon. 
006 Fear me not, because I `am' very dark, Because the sun hath scorched me, The sons of my mother were angry with me, They made me keeper of the vineyards, My vineyard -- my own -- I have not kept. 
007 Declare to me, thou whom my soul hath loved, Where thou delightest, Where thou liest down at noon, For why am I as one veiled, By the ranks of thy companions?  
008 If thou knowest not, O fair among women, Get thee forth by the traces of the flock, And feed thy kids by the shepherds' dwellings!  
009 To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared thee, my friend,  
010 Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands, Thy neck with chains.  
011 Garlands of gold we do make for thee, With studs of silver!  
012 While the king `is' in his circle, My spikenard hath given its fragrance. 
013 A bundle of myrrh `is' my beloved to me, Between my breasts it lodgeth. 
014 A cluster of cypress `is' my beloved to me, In the vineyards of En-Gedi! 
015 Lo, thou `art' fair, my friend, Lo, thou `art' fair, thine eyes `are' doves! 
016 Lo, thou `art' fair, my love, yea, pleasant, Yea, our couch `is' green, 
017 The beams of our houses `are' cedars, Our rafters `are' firs, I `am' a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys!
