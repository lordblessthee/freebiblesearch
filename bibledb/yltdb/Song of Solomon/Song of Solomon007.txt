001 As the chorus of `Mahanaim.' How beautiful were thy feet with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of thy sides `are' as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer. 
002 Thy waist `is' a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies, 
003 Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,  
004 Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of Lebanon looking to Damascus,  
005 Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as purple, The king is bound with the flowings!  
006 How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in delights.  
007 This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts to clusters.  
008 I said, `Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,  
009 And thy palate as the good wine --' Flowing to my beloved in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!  
010 I `am' my beloved's, and on me `is' his desire. 
011 Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,  
012 We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to thee my loves;  
013 The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!
