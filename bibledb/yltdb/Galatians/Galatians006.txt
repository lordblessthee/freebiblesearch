001 Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who `are' spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself -- lest thou also may be tempted; 
002 of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,  
003 for if any one doth think `himself' to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive; 
004 and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,  
005 for each one his own burden shall bear.  
006 And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things.  
007 Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,  
008 because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;  
009 and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;  
010 therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.  
011 Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;  
012 as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,  
013 for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.  
014 And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;  
015 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;  
016 and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!  
017 Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.  
018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with your spirit, brethren! Amen.
