001 To the Overseer. -- An instruction, by David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul, and saith to him, `David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What, boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God `is' all the day. 
002 Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.  
003 Thou hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.  
004 Thou hast loved all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.  
005 Also -- God doth break thee down for ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.  
006 And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.  
007 `Lo, the man who maketh not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.'  
008 And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,  
009 I thank Thee to the age, because Thou hast done `it', And I wait `on' Thy name for `it is' good before Thy saints!
