001 Bless, O my soul, Jehovah! Jehovah, my God, Thou hast been very great, Honour and majesty Thou hast put on.  
002 Covering himself `with' light as a garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain, 
003 Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on wings of wind,  
004 Making His messengers -- the winds, His ministers -- the flaming fire.  
005 He hath founded earth on its bases, It is not moved to the age and for ever.  
006 The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast covered it, Above hills do waters stand.  
007 From Thy rebuke they flee, From the voice of Thy thunder haste away.  
008 They go up hills -- they go down valleys, Unto a place Thou hast founded for them.  
009 A border Thou hast set, they pass not over, They turn not back to cover the earth.  
010 Who is sending forth fountains in valleys, Between hills they go on.  
011 They water every beast of the field, Wild asses break their thirst.  
012 By them the fowl of the heavens doth dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.  
013 Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.  
014 Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,  
015 And wine -- it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread -- the heart of man it supporteth.  
016 Satisfied `are' the trees of Jehovah, Cedars of Lebanon that He hath planted, 
017 Where birds do make nests, The stork -- the firs `are' her house. 
018 The high hills `are' for wild goats, Rocks `are' a refuge for conies, 
019 He made the moon for seasons, The sun hath known his place of entrance.  
020 Thou settest darkness, and it is night, In it doth every beast of the forest creep.  
021 The young lions are roaring for prey, And to seek from God their food.  
022 The sun riseth, they are gathered, And in their dens they crouch.  
023 Man goeth forth to his work, And to his service -- till evening.  
024 How many have been Thy works, O Jehovah, All of them in wisdom Thou hast made, Full is the earth of thy possessions.  
025 This, the sea, great and broad of sides, There `are' moving things -- innumerable, Living creatures -- small with great. 
026 There do ships go: leviathan, That Thou hast formed to play in it.  
027 All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.  
028 Thou dost give to them -- they gather, Thou dost open Thy hand -- they `are' satisfied `with' good. 
029 Thou hidest Thy face -- they are troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit -- they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.  
030 Thou sendest out Thy Spirit, they are created, And Thou renewest the face of the ground.  
031 The honour of Jehovah is to the age, Jehovah rejoiceth in His works,  
032 Who is looking to earth, and it trembleth, He cometh against hills, and they smoke.  
033 I sing to Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.  
034 Sweet is my meditation on Him, I -- I do rejoice in Jehovah.  
035 Consumed are sinners from the earth, And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah!
