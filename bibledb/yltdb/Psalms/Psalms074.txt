001 An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy pasture.  
002 Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion -- Thou didst dwell in it.  
003 Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.  
004 Roared have thine adversaries, In the midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.  
005 He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood -- axes.  
006 And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,  
007 They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,  
008 They said in their hearts, `Let us oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.  
009 Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.  
010 Till when, O God, doth an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?  
011 Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove `it'. 
012 And God `is' my king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
013 Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea-`monster', Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters, 
014 Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.  
015 Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.  
016 Thine `is' the day, also Thine `is' the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver -- the sun. 
017 Thou hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.  
018 Remember this -- an enemy reproached Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.  
019 Give not up to a company, The soul of Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.  
020 Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.  
021 Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,  
022 Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember Thy reproach from a fool all the day.  
023 Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!
