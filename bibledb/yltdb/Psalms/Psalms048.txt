001 A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah. Great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, In the city of our God -- His holy hill. 
002 Beautiful `for' elevation, A joy of all the land, `is' Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great king. 
003 God in her high places is known for a tower.  
004 For, lo, the kings met, they passed by together,  
005 They have seen -- so they have marvelled, They have been troubled, they were hastened away.  
006 Trembling hath seized them there, Pain, as of a travailing woman.  
007 By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of Tarshish.  
008 As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God, God doth establish her -- to the age. Selah.  
009 We have thought, O God, of Thy kindness, In the midst of Thy temple,  
010 As `is' Thy name, O God, so `is' Thy praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness hath filled Thy right hand. 
011 Rejoice doth Mount Zion, The daughters of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Thy judgments.  
012 Compass Zion, and go round her, count her towers,  
013 Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider her high places, So that ye recount to a later generation,  
014 That this God `is' our God -- To the age and for ever, He -- he doth lead us over death!
