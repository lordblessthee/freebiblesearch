001 To the Overseer, with stringed instruments. -- A Psalm, a Song. God doth favour us and bless us, Doth cause His face to shine with us. Selah.  
002 For the knowledge in earth of Thy way, among all nations of Thy salvation.  
003 Praise Thee do peoples, O God, Praise Thee do peoples, all of them.  
004 Rejoice and sing do nations, For Thou judgest peoples uprightly, And peoples on earth comfortest. Selah.  
005 Confess Thee do peoples, O God, Confess Thee do peoples -- all of them.  
006 Earth hath given her increase, God doth bless us -- our God,  
007 God doth bless us, and all ends of earth fear Him!
