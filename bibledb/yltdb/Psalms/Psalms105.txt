001 Give ye thanks to Jehovah -- call ye in His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.  
002 Sing ye to Him -- sing praise to Him, Meditate ye on all His wonders.  
003 Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.  
004 Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek ye His face continually.  
005 Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the judgments of His mouth.  
006 O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.  
007 He `is' Jehovah our God, In all the earth `are' His judgments. 
008 He hath remembered to the age His covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,  
009 That He hath made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,  
010 And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel -- a covenant age-during,  
011 Saying, `To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,'  
012 In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners in it.  
013 And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.  
014 He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.  
015 `Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do not evil.'  
016 And He calleth a famine on the land, The whole staff of bread He hath broken.  
017 He hath sent before them a man, For a servant hath Joseph been sold.  
018 They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron hath entered his soul,  
019 Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him.  
020 The king hath sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.  
021 He hath made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions.  
022 To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he maketh wise.  
023 And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And Jacob hath sojourned in the land of Ham.  
024 And He maketh His people very fruitful, And maketh it mightier than its adversaries.  
025 He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.  
026 He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed on.  
027 They have set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.  
028 He hath sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not provoked His word.  
029 He hath turned their waters to blood, And putteth to death their fish.  
030 Teemed hath their land `with' frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings. 
031 He hath said, and the beetle cometh, Lice into all their border.  
032 He hath made their showers hail, A flaming fire `is' in their land. 
033 And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.  
034 He hath said, and the locust cometh, And the cankerworm -- innumerable,  
035 And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.  
036 And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,  
037 And bringeth them out with silver and gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.  
038 Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.  
039 He hath spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to enlighten the night.  
040 They have asked, and He bringeth quails, And `with' bread of heaven satisfieth them. 
041 He hath opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone on in dry places -- a river.  
042 For He hath remembered His holy word, With Abraham His servant,  
043 And He bringeth forth His people with joy, With singing His chosen ones.  
044 And He giveth to them the lands of nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,  
045 That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may keep. Praise ye Jehovah!
