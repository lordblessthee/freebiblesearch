001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. The heavens `are' recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse `is' declaring. 
002 Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.  
003 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.  
004 Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,  
005 And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.  
006 From the end of the heavens `is' his going out, And his revolution `is' unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat. 
007 The law of Jehovah `is' perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah `are' stedfast, Making wise the simple, 
008 The precepts of Jehovah `are' upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah `is' pure, enlightening the eyes, 
009 The fear of Jehovah `is' clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah `are' true, They have been righteous -- together. 
010 They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.  
011 Also -- Thy servant is warned by them, `In keeping them `is' a great reward.' 
012 Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,  
013 Also -- from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,  
014 Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!
