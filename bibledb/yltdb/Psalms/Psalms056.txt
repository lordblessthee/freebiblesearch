001 To the Overseer. -- `On the Dumb Dove far off.' -- A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,  
002 Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day, For many `are' fighting against me, O most High, 
003 The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee.  
004 In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, I fear not what flesh doth to me.  
005 All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts `are' for evil, 
006 They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul.  
007 By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God.  
008 My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou -- place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?  
009 Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God `is' for me. 
010 In God I praise the word, In Jehovah I praise the word.  
011 In God I trusted, I fear not what man doth to me,  
012 On me, O God, `are' Thy vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee. 
013 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!
