001 To the Overseer with stringed instruments. -- A Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. In Judah `is' God known, in Israel His name `is' great. 
002 And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His habitation in Zion.  
003 There he hath shivered arrows of a bow, Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.  
004 Bright `art' Thou, honourable above hills of prey. 
005 Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found their hands.  
006 From Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.  
007 Thou, fearful `art' Thou, And who doth stand before Thee, Since Thou hast been angry! 
008 From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment, Earth hath feared, and hath been still,  
009 In the rising of God to judgment, To save all the humble of earth. Selah.  
010 For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee, The remnant of fierceness Thou girdest on.  
011 Vow and complete to Jehovah your God, All ye surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.  
012 He doth gather the spirit of leaders, Fearful to the kings of earth!
