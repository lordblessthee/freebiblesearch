001 To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.  
002 I call to God Most High, To God `who' is perfecting for me. 
003 He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached -- who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth.  
004 My soul `is' in the midst of lions, I lie down `among' flames -- sons of men, Their teeth `are' a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword. 
005 Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour.  
006 A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah.  
007 Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise.  
008 Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn.  
009 I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations.  
010 For great unto the heavens `is' Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth. 
011 Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!
