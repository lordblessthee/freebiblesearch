001 A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:  
002 Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.  
003 Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.  
004 Jehovah `is' righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked. 
005 Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.  
006 They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,  
007 That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.  
008 And the passers by have not said, `The blessing of Jehovah `is' on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'
