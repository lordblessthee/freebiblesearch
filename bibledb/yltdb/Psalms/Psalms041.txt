001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil doth Jehovah deliver him.  
002 Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his enemies.  
003 Jehovah supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness.  
004 I -- I said, `O Jehovah, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'  
005 Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth -- his name hath perished!  
006 And if he came to see -- vanity he speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out -- at the street he speaketh.  
007 All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:  
008 A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again.  
009 Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,  
010 And Thou, Jehovah, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them.  
011 By this I have known, That Thou hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me.  
012 As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age.  
013 Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age -- and unto the age. Amen and Amen.
