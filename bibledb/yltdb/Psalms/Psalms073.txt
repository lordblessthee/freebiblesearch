001 A Psalm of Asaph. Only -- good to Israel `is' God, to the clean of heart. And I -- as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside, 
002 As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,  
003 The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,  
004 And their might `is' firm. 
005 In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.  
006 Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.  
007 Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;  
008 They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.  
009 They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.  
010 Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.  
011 And they have said, `How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'  
012 Lo, these `are' the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength. 
013 Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,  
014 And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof `is' every morning. 
015 If I have said, `I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.  
016 And I think to know this, Perverseness it `is' in mine eyes, 
017 Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.  
018 Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.  
019 How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended -- consumed from terrors.  
020 As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.  
021 For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,  
022 And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee. 
023 And I `am' continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand. 
024 With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.  
025 Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.  
026 Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion `is' God to the age. 
027 For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.  
028 And I -- nearness of God to me `is' good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!
