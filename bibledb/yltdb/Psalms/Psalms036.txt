001 To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, `Fear of God is not before his eyes,  
002 For he made `it' smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated. 
003 The words of his mouth `are' iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently -- to do good. 
004 Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'  
005 O Jehovah, in the heavens `is' Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness `is' unto the clouds. 
006 Thy righteousness `is' as mountains of God, Thy judgments `are' a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah. 
007 How precious `is' Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust. 
008 They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.  
009 For with Thee `is' a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light. 
010 Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.  
011 Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.  
012 There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
