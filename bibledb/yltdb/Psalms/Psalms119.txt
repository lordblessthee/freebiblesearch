001 `Aleph.' O the happiness of those perfect in the way, They are walking in the law of Jehovah, 
002 O the happiness of those keeping His testimonies, With the whole heart they seek Him.  
003 Yea, they have not done iniquity, In His ways they have walked.  
004 Thou hast commanded us Thy precepts to keep diligently,  
005 O that my ways were prepared to keep Thy statutes,  
006 Then I am not ashamed In my looking unto all Thy commands.  
007 I confess Thee with uprightness of heart, In my learning the judgments of Thy righteousness.  
008 Thy statutes I keep, leave me not utterly!  
009 `Beth.' With what doth a young man purify his path? To observe -- according to Thy word. 
010 With all my heart I have sought Thee, Let me not err from Thy commands.  
011 In my heart I have hid Thy saying, That I sin not before Thee.  
012 Blessed `art' Thou, O Jehovah, teach me Thy statutes. 
013 With my lips I have recounted All the judgments of Thy mouth.  
014 In the way of Thy testimonies I have joyed, As over all wealth.  
015 In Thy precepts I meditate, And I behold attentively Thy paths.  
016 In Thy statutes I delight myself, I do not forget Thy word.  
017 `Gimel.' Confer benefits on Thy servant, I live, and I keep Thy word. 
018 Uncover mine eyes, and I behold wonders out of Thy law.  
019 A sojourner I `am' on earth, Hide not from me Thy commands. 
020 Broken hath my soul for desire Unto Thy judgments at all times.  
021 Thou hast rebuked the cursed proud, Who are erring from Thy commands.  
022 Remove from me reproach and contempt, For Thy testimonies I have kept.  
023 Princes also sat -- against me they spoke, Thy servant doth meditate in Thy statutes,  
024 Thy testimonies also `are' my delight, The men of my counsel! 
025 `Daleth.' Cleaved to the dust hath my soul, Quicken me according to Thy word. 
026 My ways I have recounted, And Thou answerest me, teach me Thy statutes,  
027 The way of Thy precepts cause me to understand, And I meditate in Thy wonders.  
028 My soul hath dropped from affliction, Establish me according to Thy word.  
029 The way of falsehood turn aside from me And with Thy law favour me.  
030 The way of faithfulness I have chosen, Thy judgments I have compared,  
031 I have adhered to Thy testimonies, O Jehovah, put me not to shame.  
032 The way of Thy commands I run, For Thou dost enlarge my heart!  
033 `He.' Show me, O Jehovah, the way of Thy statutes, And I keep it -- `to' the end. 
034 Cause me to understand, and I keep Thy law, And observe it with the whole heart.  
035 Cause me to tread in the path of Thy commands, For in it I have delighted.  
036 Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, And not unto dishonest gain.  
037 Remove mine eyes from seeing vanity, In Thy way quicken Thou me. 
038 Establish to Thy servant Thy saying, That `is' concerning Thy fear. 
039 Remove my reproach that I have feared, For Thy judgments `are' good. 
040 Lo, I have longed for Thy precepts, In Thy righteousness quicken Thou me,  
041 `Waw.' And meet me doth Thy kindness, O Jehovah, Thy salvation according to Thy saying. 
042 And I answer him who is reproaching me a word, For I have trusted in Thy word.  
043 And Thou takest not utterly away From my mouth the word of truth, Because for Thy judgment I have hoped.  
044 And I keep Thy law continually, To the age and for ever.  
045 And I walk habitually in a broad place, For Thy precepts I have sought.  
046 And I speak of Thy testimonies before kings, And I am not ashamed.  
047 And I delight myself in Thy commands, That I have loved,  
048 And I lift up my hands unto Thy commands, That I have loved, And I do meditate on Thy statutes!  
049 `Zain.' Remember the word to Thy servant, On which Thou hast caused me to hope. 
050 This `is' my comfort in mine affliction, That Thy saying hath quickened me. 
051 The proud have utterly scorned me, From Thy law I have not turned aside.  
052 I remembered Thy judgments of old, O Jehovah, And I comfort myself.  
053 Horror hath seized me, Because of the wicked forsaking Thy law.  
054 Songs have been to me Thy statutes, In the house of my sojournings.  
055 I have remembered in the night Thy name, O Jehovah, And I do keep Thy law.  
056 This hath been to me, That Thy precepts I have kept!  
057 `Cheth.' My portion `is' Jehovah; I have said -- to keep Thy words, 
058 I appeased Thy face with the whole heart, Favour me according to Thy saying.  
059 I have reckoned my ways, And turn back my feet unto Thy testimonies.  
060 I have made haste, And delayed not, to keep Thy commands.  
061 Cords of the wicked have surrounded me, Thy law I have not forgotten.  
062 At midnight I rise to give thanks to Thee, For the judgments of Thy righteousness.  
063 A companion I `am' to all who fear Thee, And to those keeping Thy precepts. 
064 Of Thy kindness, O Jehovah, the earth is full, Thy statutes teach Thou me!  
065 `Teth.' Good Thou didst with Thy servant, O Jehovah, According to Thy word. 
066 The goodness of reason and knowledge teach me, For in Thy commands I have believed.  
067 Before I am afflicted, I -- I am erring, And now Thy saying I have kept.  
068 Good Thou `art', and doing good, Teach me Thy statutes. 
069 Forged against me falsehood have the proud, I with the whole heart keep Thy precepts.  
070 Insensate as fat hath been their heart, I -- in Thy law I have delighted.

072 Better to me `is' the law of Thy mouth Than thousands of gold and silver! 
073 `Yod.' Thy hands made me and establish me, Cause me to understand, and I learn Thy commands. 
074 Those fearing Thee see me and rejoice, Because for Thy word I have hoped.

076 Let, I pray Thee, Thy kindness be to comfort me, According to Thy saying to Thy servant.  
077 Meet me do Thy mercies, and I live, For Thy law `is' my delight. 
078 Ashamed are the proud, For `with' falsehood they dealt perversely with me. I meditate in Thy precepts. 
079 Those fearing Thee turn back to me, And those knowing Thy testimonies.  
080 My heart is perfect in Thy statutes, So that I am not ashamed. 
081 `Kaph.' Consumed for Thy salvation hath been my soul, For Thy word I have hoped. 
082 Consumed have been mine eyes for Thy word, Saying, `When doth it comfort me?'  
083 For I have been as a bottle in smoke, Thy statutes I have not forgotten.  
084 How many `are' the days of Thy servant? When dost Thou execute Against my pursuers judgment? 
085 The proud have digged for me pits, That `are' not according to Thy law. 
086 All Thy commands `are' faithfulness, `With' falsehood they have pursued me, Help Thou me. 
087 Almost consumed me on earth have they, And I -- I have not forsaken Thy precepts.  
088 According to Thy kindness quicken Thou me, And I keep the testimony of Thy mouth!  
089 `Lamed.' To the age, O Jehovah, Thy word is set up in the heavens. 
090 To all generations Thy faithfulness, Thou didst establish earth, and it standeth.  
091 According to Thine ordinances They have stood this day, for the whole `are' Thy servants. 
092 Unless Thy law `were' my delights, Then had I perished in mine affliction. 
093 To the age I forget not Thy precepts, For by them Thou hast quickened me.  
094 I `am' Thine, save Thou me, For Thy precepts I have sought. 
095 Thy wicked waited for me to destroy me, Thy testimonies I understand.
