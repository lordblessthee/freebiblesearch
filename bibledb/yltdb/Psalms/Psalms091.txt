001 He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,  
002 He is saying of Jehovah, `My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'  
003 For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.  
004 With His pinion He covereth thee over, And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler `is' His truth. 
005 Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,  
006 Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,  
007 There fall at thy side a thousand, And a myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.  
008 But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the reward of the wicked thou seest,  
009 (For Thou, O Jehovah, `art' my refuge,) The Most High thou madest thy habitation. 
010 Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a plague cometh not near thy tent,  
011 For His messengers He chargeth for thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,  
012 On the hands they bear thee up, Lest thou smite against a stone thy foot.  
013 On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou trampest young lion and dragon.  
014 Because in Me he hath delighted, I also deliver him -- I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.  
015 He doth call Me, and I answer him, I `am' with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him. 
016 With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!
