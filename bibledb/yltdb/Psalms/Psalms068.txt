001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm, a song of David. Rise doth God -- scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him flee from His face.  
002 As the driving away of smoke Thou drivest away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the presence of God.  
003 And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, And they joy with gladness.  
004 Sing ye to God -- praise His name, Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah `is' His name, and exult before Him. 
005 Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, `Is' God in His holy habitation. 
006 God -- causing the lonely to dwell at home, Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, Only -- the refractory have inhabited a dry place.  
007 O God, in Thy going forth before Thy people, In Thy stepping through the wilderness, Selah.  
008 The earth hath shaken, Yea, the heavens have dropped before God, This Sinai -- before God, the God of Israel.  
009 A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it hath been weary, Thou hast established it.  
010 Thy company have dwelt in it, Thou preparest in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.  
011 The Lord doth give the saying, The female proclaimers `are' a numerous host. 
012 Kings of hosts flee utterly away, And a female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.  
013 Though ye do lie between two boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.  
014 When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it, It doth snow in Salmon.  
015 A hill of God `is' the hill of Bashan, A hill of heights `is' the hill of Bashan. 
016 Why do ye envy, O high hills, The hill God hath desired for His seat? Jehovah also doth tabernacle for ever.  
017 The chariots of God `are' myriads, thousands of changes, The Lord `is' among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary. 
018 Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast taken captive captivity, Thou hast taken gifts for men, That even the refractory may rest, O Jah God.  
019 Blessed `is' the Lord, day by day He layeth on us. God Himself `is' our salvation. Selah. 
020 God Himself `is' to us a God for deliverances, And Jehovah Lord hath the outgoings of death. 
021 Only -- God doth smite The head of His enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.  
022 The Lord said: `From Bashan I bring back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.  
023 So that thou dashest thy foot in blood, `In the blood of' enemies -- the tongue of Thy dogs.' 
024 They have seen Thy goings, O God, Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.  
025 Singers have been before, Behind `are' players on instruments, In the midst virgins playing with timbrels. 
026 In assemblies bless ye God, The Lord -- from the fountain of Israel.  
027 There `is' little Benjamin their ruler, Heads of Judah their defence, Heads of Zebulun -- heads of Naphtali. 
028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength, Be strong, O God, this Thou hast wrought for us.  
029 Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem, To Thee do kings bring a present.  
030 Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, Scatter Thou peoples delighting in conflicts.  
031 Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush causeth her hands to run to God.  
032 Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to God, Praise ye the Lord. Selah.  
033 To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, Lo, He giveth with His voice a strong voice.  
034 Ascribe ye strength to God, Over Israel `is' His excellency, and His strength in the clouds. 
035 Fearful, O God, out of Thy sanctuaries, The God of Israel Himself, Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed `is' God!
