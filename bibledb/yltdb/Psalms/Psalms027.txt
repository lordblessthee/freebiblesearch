001 By David. Jehovah `is' my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah `is' the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid? 
002 When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.  
003 Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I `am' confident. 
004 One `thing' I asked of Jehovah -- it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple. 
005 For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.  
006 And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies -- my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.  
007 Hear, O Jehovah, my voice -- I call, And favour me, and answer me.  
008 To Thee said my heart `They sought my face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.'  
009 Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.  
010 When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.  
011 Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.  
012 Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.  
013 I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!  
014 Look unto Jehovah -- be strong, And He doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!
