001 Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.  
002 Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.  
003 Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.  
004 For great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He `is' over all gods. 
005 For all the gods of the peoples `are' nought, And Jehovah made the heavens. 
006 Honour and majesty `are' before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary. 
007 Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.  
008 Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.  
009 Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.  
010 Say among nations, `Jehovah hath reigned, Also -- established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'  
011 The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.  
012 The field exulteth, and all that `is' in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest, 
013 Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!
