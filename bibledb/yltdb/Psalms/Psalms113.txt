001 Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.  
002 The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age. 
003 From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised `is' the name of Jehovah. 
004 High above all nations `is' Jehovah, Above the heavens `is' his honour. 
005 Who `is' as Jehovah our God, He is exalting `Himself' to sit? 
006 He is humbling `Himself' to look On the heavens and on the earth. 
007 He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.  
008 To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.  
009 Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!
