001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou keepest me.  
002 Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble `for' wars. 
003 They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder `is' under their lips. Selah. 
004 Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.  
005 The proud hid a snare for me -- and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.  
006 I have said to Jehovah, `My God `art' Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.' 
007 O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.  
008 Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.  
009 The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.  
010 They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits -- they arise not.  
011 A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence -- evil hunteth to overflowing.  
012 I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.  
013 Only -- the righteous give thanks to Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!
