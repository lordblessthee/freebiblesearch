001 A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.  
002 Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.  
003 And Thou, O Jehovah, `art' a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head. 
004 My voice `is' unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah. 
005 I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.  
006 I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.  
007 Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies `on' the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken. 
008 Of Jehovah `is' this salvation; On Thy people `is' Thy blessing! Selah.
