001 Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.  
002 Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Thy name to the age and for ever.  
003 Great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching. 
004 Generation to generation praiseth Thy works, And Thy mighty acts they declare.  
005 The honour -- the glory of Thy majesty, And the matters of Thy wonders I declare.  
006 And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell, And Thy greatness I recount.  
007 The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing.  
008 Gracious and merciful `is' Jehovah, Slow to anger, and great in kindness. 
009 Good `is' Jehovah to all, And His mercies `are' over all His works. 
010 Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy works, And Thy saints do bless Thee.  
011 The honour of Thy kingdom they tell, And `of' Thy might they speak, 
012 To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.  
013 Thy kingdom `is' a kingdom of all ages, And Thy dominion `is' in all generations. 
014 Jehovah is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.  
015 The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,  
016 Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.  
017 Righteous `is' Jehovah in all His ways, And kind in all His works. 
018 Near `is' Jehovah to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth. 
019 The desire of those fearing Him He doth, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.  
020 Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.  
021 The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh, And all flesh doth bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!
