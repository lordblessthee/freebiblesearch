001 A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.  
002 The labour of thy hands thou surely eatest, Happy `art' thou, and good `is' to thee. 
003 Thy wife `is' as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table. 
004 Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Jehovah.  
005 Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,  
006 And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on Israel!
