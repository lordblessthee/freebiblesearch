001 A Psalm of David. To Jehovah `is' the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it. 
002 For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.  
003 Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?  
004 The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.  
005 He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.  
006 This `is' a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah. 
007 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!  
008 Who `is' this -- `the king of glory?' Jehovah -- strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle. 
009 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!  
010 Who `is' He -- this `king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts -- He `is' the king of glory! Selah.
