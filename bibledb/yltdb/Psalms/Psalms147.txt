001 Praise ye Jah! For `it is' good to praise our God, For pleasant -- comely `is' praise. 
002 Building Jerusalem `is' Jehovah, The driven away of Israel He gathereth. 
003 Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, And is binding up their griefs.  
004 Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He giveth names.  
005 Great `is' our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration. 
006 Jehovah is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.  
007 Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving, Sing ye to our God with a harp.  
008 Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up `on' mountains, 
009 Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.  
010 Not in the might of the horse doth He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.  
011 Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.  
012 Glorify, O Jerusalem, Jehovah, Praise thy God, O Zion.  
013 For He did strengthen the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy sons in thy midst.  
014 Who is making thy border peace, `With' the fat of wheat He satisfieth Thee. 
015 Who is sending forth His saying `on' earth, Very speedily doth His word run. 
016 Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.  
017 Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who doth stand?  
018 He sendeth forth His word and melteth them, He causeth His wind to blow -- the waters flow.  
019 Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.  
020 He hath not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye Jah!
