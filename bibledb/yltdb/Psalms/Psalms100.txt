001 A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.  
002 Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.  
003 Know that Jehovah He `is' God, He made us, and we are His, His people -- and the flock of His pasture. 
004 Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.  
005 For good `is' Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
