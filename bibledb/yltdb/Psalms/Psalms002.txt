001 Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?  
002 Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:  
003 `Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.'  
004 He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.  
005 Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He doth trouble them:  
006 `And I -- I have anointed My King, Upon Zion -- My holy hill.'  
007 I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, `My Son Thou `art', I to-day have brought thee forth. 
008 Ask of Me and I give nations -- thy inheritance, And thy possession -- the ends of earth.  
009 Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.'  
010 And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,  
011 Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.  
012 Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!
