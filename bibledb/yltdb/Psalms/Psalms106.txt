001 Praise ye Jah, give thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, `is' His kindness. 
002 Who doth utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?  
003 O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.  
004 Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour of Thy people, Look after me in Thy salvation.  
005 To look on the good of Thy chosen ones, To rejoice in the joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.  
006 We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.  
007 Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Thy wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Thy kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.  
008 And He saveth them for His name's sake, To make known His might,  
009 And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.  
010 And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.  
011 And waters cover their adversaries, One of them hath not been left.  
012 And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,  
013 They have hasted -- forgotten His works, They have not waited for His counsel.  
014 And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a desert.  
015 And He giveth to them their request, And sendeth leanness into their soul.  
016 And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron, Jehovah's holy one.  
017 Earth openeth, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.  
018 And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on fire the wicked.  
019 They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten image,  
020 And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs.  
021 They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,  
022 Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.  
023 And He saith to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath from destroying.  
024 And they kick against the desirable land, They have not given credence to His word.  
025 And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah.  
026 And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall in a wilderness,  
027 And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to scatter them through lands.  
028 And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices of the dead,  
029 And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,  
030 And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment, And the plague is restrained,  
031 And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all generations -- unto the age.  
032 And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,  
033 For they have provoked his spirit, And he speaketh wrongfully with his lips.  
034 They have not destroyed the peoples, As Jehovah had said to them,  
035 And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,  
036 And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.  
037 And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers,  
038 And they shed innocent blood -- Blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.  
039 And they are defiled with their works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.  
040 And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people, And He doth abominate His inheritance.  
041 And giveth them into the hand of nations, And those hating them rule over them,  
042 And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled under their hand.  
043 Many times He doth deliver them, And they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.  
044 And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry,  
045 And remembereth for them His covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.  
046 And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors.  
047 Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in Thy praise.  
048 Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, `Amen, praise Jah!'
