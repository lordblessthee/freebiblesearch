001 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,  
002 Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.  
003 Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah `is' good, Sing praise to His name, for `it is' pleasant. 
004 For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.  
005 For I have known that great `is' Jehovah, Yea, our Lord `is' above all gods. 
006 All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,  
007 Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.  
008 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.  
009 He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.  
010 Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,  
011 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.  
012 And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,  
013 O Jehovah, Thy name `is' to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations. 
014 For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.  
015 The idols of the nations `are' silver and gold, Work of the hands of man. 
016 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,  
017 Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose -- there is no breath in their mouth!  
018 Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.  
019 O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,  
020 O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.  
021 Blessed `is' Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem -- praise ye Jah!
