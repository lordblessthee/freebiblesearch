001 A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods -- Jehovah -- hath spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of the sun unto its going in.  
002 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.  
003 Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire before Him doth devour, And round about him it hath been very tempestuous.  
004 He doth call unto the heavens from above, And unto the earth, to judge His people.  
005 Gather ye to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.  
006 And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself `is' judge. Selah. 
007 Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify against thee, God, thy God `am' I. 
008 Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee, Yea, thy burnt-offerings `Are' before Me continually. 
009 I take not from thy house a bullock, From thy folds he goats.  
010 For Mine `is' every beast of the forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen. 
011 I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild beast of the field `is' with Me. 
012 If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For Mine `is' the world and its fulness. 
013 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of he-goats?  
014 Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High thy vows.  
015 And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver thee, and thou honourest Me.  
016 And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee -- to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy mouth?  
017 Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And dost cast My words behind thee.  
018 If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou art pleased with him, And with adulterers `is' thy portion. 
019 Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil, And thy tongue joineth deceit together,  
020 Thou sittest, against thy brother thou speakest, Against a son of thy mother givest slander.  
021 These thou didst, and I kept silent, Thou hast thought that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array before thine eyes.  
022 Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.  
023 He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!
