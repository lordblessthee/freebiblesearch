001 A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save `for' Jehovah -- who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say), 
002 Save `for' Jehovah -- who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us, 
003 Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,  
004 Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,  
005 Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.  
006 Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth. 
007 Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.  
008 Our help `is' in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!
