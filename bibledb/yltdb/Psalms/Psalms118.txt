001 Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age `is' His kindness. 
002 I pray you, let Israel say, That, to the age `is' His kindness. 
003 I pray you, let the house of Aaron say, That, to the age `is' His kindness. 
004 I pray you, let those fearing Jehovah say, That, to the age `is' His kindness. 
005 From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.  
006 Jehovah `is' for me, I do not fear what man doth to me. 
007 Jehovah `is' for me among my helpers, And I -- I look on those hating me. 
008 Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man,  
009 Better to take refuge in Jehovah, Than to trust in princes.  
010 All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.  
011 They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.  
012 They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.  
013 Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Jehovah hath helped me.  
014 My strength and song `is' Jah, And He is to me for salvation. 
015 A voice of singing and salvation, `Is' in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly. 
016 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.  
017 I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,  
018 Jah hath sorely chastened me, And to death hath not given me up.  
019 Open ye to me gates of righteousness, I enter into them -- I thank Jah.  
020 This `is' the gate to Jehovah, The righteous enter into it. 
021 I thank Thee, for Thou hast answered me, And art to me for salvation.  
022 A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.  
023 From Jehovah hath this been, It `is' wonderful in our eyes, 
024 This `is' the day Jehovah hath made, We rejoice and are glad in it. 
025 I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, save, I pray Thee, I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, prosper, I pray Thee.  
026 Blessed `is' he who is coming In the name of Jehovah, We blessed you from the house of Jehovah, 
027 God `is' Jehovah, and He giveth to us light, Direct ye the festal-sacrifice with cords, Unto the horns of the altar. 
028 My God Thou `art', and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee. 
029 Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, `is' His kindness!
