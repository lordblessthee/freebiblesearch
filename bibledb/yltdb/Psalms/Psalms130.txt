001 A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.  
002 Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.  
003 If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?  
004 But with Thee `is' forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared. 
005 I hoped `for' Jehovah -- hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited. 
006 My soul `is' for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning! 
007 Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah `is' kindness, And abundant with Him `is' redemption. 
008 And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
