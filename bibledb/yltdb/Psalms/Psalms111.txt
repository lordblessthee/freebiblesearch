001 Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.  
002 Great `are' the works of Jehovah, Sought out by all desiring them. 
003 Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.  
004 A memorial He hath made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful `is' Jehovah. 
005 Prey He hath given to those fearing Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.  
006 The power of His works He hath declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.  
007 The works of His hands `are' true and just, Stedfast `are' all His appointments. 
008 They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.  
009 Redemption He hath sent to His people, He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful `is' His name. 
010 The beginning of wisdom `is' fear of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise `is' standing for ever!
