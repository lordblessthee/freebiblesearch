001 A Prayer of David. Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, Answer me, for I `am' poor and needy. 
002 Keep my soul, for I `am' pious, Save Thy servant -- who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God. 
003 Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day.  
004 Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.  
005 For Thou, Lord, `art' good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee. 
006 Hear, O Jehovah, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications.  
007 In a day of my distress I call Thee, For Thou dost answer me.  
008 There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Thy works there are none.  
009 All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Thy name.  
010 For great `art' Thou, and doing wonders, Thou `art' God Thyself alone. 
011 Show me, O Jehovah, Thy way, I walk in Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name.  
012 I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age.  
013 For Thy kindness `is' great toward me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol. 
014 O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,  
015 And Thou, O Lord, `art' God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth. 
016 Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.  
017 Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For Thou, O Jehovah, hast helped me, Yea, Thou hast comforted me!
