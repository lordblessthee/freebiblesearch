001 A Psalm of David. Jehovah `is' my shepherd, I do not lack, 
002 In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.  
003 My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,  
004 Also -- when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou `art' with me, Thy rod and Thy staff -- they comfort me. 
005 Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!  
006 Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling `is' in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!
