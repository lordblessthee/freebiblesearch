001 To the Overseer. -- `On a disease.' -- An instruction, by David. A fool said in his heart, `There is no God.' They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There is none doing good.  
002 God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if there be an understanding one, `One' seeking God. 
003 Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is none doing good -- not even one.  
004 Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.  
005 There they feared a fear -- there was no fear, For God hath scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against thee, Thou hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.  
006 Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back `to' a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!
