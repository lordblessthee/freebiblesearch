001 Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.  
002 Jehovah in Zion `is' great, And high He `is' over all the peoples. 
003 They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy `it' is.' 
004 And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done.  
005 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy `is' He. 
006 Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.  
007 In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.  
008 O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.  
009 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy `is' Jehovah our God!
