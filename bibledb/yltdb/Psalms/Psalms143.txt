001 A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me -- in Thy righteousness.  
002 And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one living is justified before Thee.  
003 For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As the dead of old.  
004 And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my heart become desolate.  
005 I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse.  
006 I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul `is' as a weary land for Thee. Selah. 
007 Haste, answer me, O Jehovah, My spirit hath been consumed, Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been compared with those going down `to' the pit. 
008 Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul.  
009 Deliver me from mine enemies, O Jehovah, Near Thee I am covered.  
010 Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For Thou `art' my God -- Thy Spirit `is' good, Lead me into a land of uprightness. 
011 For Thy name's sake O Jehovah, Thou dost quicken me, In Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress my soul,  
012 And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I `am' Thy servant!
