001 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. `For the Virgins.' -- A song. God `is' to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely. 
002 Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.  
003 Roar -- troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.  
004 A river -- its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Thy holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.  
005 God `is' in her midst -- she is not moved, God doth help her at the turn of the morn! 
006 Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He hath given forth with His voice, earth melteth.  
007 Jehovah of Hosts `is' with us, A tower for us `is' the God of Jacob. Selah. 
008 Come ye, see the works of Jehovah, Who hath done astonishing things in the earth,  
009 Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder, Chariots he doth burn with fire.  
010 Desist, and know that I `am' God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth. 
011 Jehovah of hosts `is' with us, A tower for us `is' the God of Jacob! Selah.
