001 A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and before Jehovah poureth out his plaint. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.  
002 Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.  
003 For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.  
004 Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.  
005 From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.  
006 I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.  
007 I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.  
008 All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.  
009 Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,  
010 From Thine indignation and Thy wrath, For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.  
011 My days as a shadow `are' stretched out, And I -- as the herb I am withered. 
012 And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.  
013 Thou -- Thou risest -- Thou pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.  
014 For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.  
015 And nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,  
016 For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath been seen in His honour,  
017 He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.  
018 This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.  
019 For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively,  
020 To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,  
021 To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,  
022 In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms -- to serve Jehovah.  
023 He hath humbled in the way my power, He hath shortened my days.  
024 I say, `My God, take me not up in the midst of my days,' Through all generations `are' Thine years. 
025 Beforetime the earth Thou didst found, And the work of Thy hands `are' the heavens. 
026 They -- They perish, and Thou remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou changest them, And they are changed. 
027 And Thou `art' the same, and Thine years are not finished. 
028 The sons of Thy servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!
