001 A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, `To the house of Jehovah we go.'  
002 Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!  
003 Jerusalem -- the builded one -- `Is' as a city that is joined to itself together. 
004 For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.  
005 For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.  
006 Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.  
007 Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,  
008 For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, `Peace `be' in thee.' 
009 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!
