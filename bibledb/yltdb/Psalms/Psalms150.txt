001 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye God in His holy place, Praise Him in the expanse of His strength.  
002 Praise Him in His mighty acts, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness.  
003 Praise Him with blowing of trumpet, Praise Him with psaltery and harp.  
004 Praise Him with timbrel and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and organ.  
005 Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, Praise Him with cymbals of shouting.  
006 All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!
