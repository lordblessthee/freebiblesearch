001 A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.  
002 Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.  
003 The voice of Jehovah `is' on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah `is' on many waters. 
004 The voice of Jehovah `is' with power, The voice of Jehovah `is' with majesty, 
005 The voice of Jehovah `is' shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon. 
006 And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,  
007 The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,  
008 The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.  
009 The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, `Glory.'  
010 Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king -- to the age,  
011 Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
