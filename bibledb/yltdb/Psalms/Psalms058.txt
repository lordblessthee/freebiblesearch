001 To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure, by David. Is it true, O dumb one, righteously ye speak? Uprightly ye judge, O sons of men?  
002 Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the land the violence of your hands ye ponder.  
003 The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.  
004 Their poison `is' as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear, 
005 Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful.  
006 O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Jehovah.  
007 They are melted as waters, They go up and down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off.  
008 As a snail that melteth he goeth on, `As' an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun. 
009 Before your pots discern the bramble, As well the raw as the heated He whirleth away.  
010 The righteous rejoiceth that he hath seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked.  
011 And man saith: `Surely fruit `is' for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'
