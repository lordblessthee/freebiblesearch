001 To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not,' by David. -- A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house to put him to death. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high.  
002 Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me.  
003 For, lo, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Jehovah.  
004 Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.  
005 And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.  
006 They turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.  
007 Lo, they belch out with their mouths, Swords `are' in their lips, for `Who heareth?' 
008 And Thou, O Jehovah dost laugh at them, Thou dost mock at all the nations.  
009 O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For God `is' my tower -- the God of my kindness. 
010 God doth go before me, He causeth me to look on mine enemies.  
011 Slay them not, lest my people forget, Shake them by Thy strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.  
012 The sin of their mouth `is' a word of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and lying they recount. 
013 Consume in fury, consume and they are not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.  
014 And they turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.  
015 They -- they wander for food, If they are not satisfied -- then they murmur.  
016 And I -- I sing `of' Thy strength, And I sing at morn `of' Thy kindness, For thou hast been a tower to me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity. 
017 O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise, For God `is' my tower, the God of my kindness!
