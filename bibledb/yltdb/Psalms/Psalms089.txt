001 An instruction, by Ethan the Ezrahite. Of the kind acts of Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth,  
002 For I said, `To the age is kindness built, The heavens! Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.'  
003 I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant:  
004 `Even to the age do I establish thy seed, And have built to generation and generation thy throne. Selah.  
005 and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O Jehovah, Thy faithfulness also `is' in an assembly of holy ones. 
006 For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Jehovah? Is like to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?  
007 God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.  
008 O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who `is' like Thee -- a strong Jah? And Thy faithfulness `is' round about Thee. 
009 Thou `art' ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them. 
010 Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies.  
011 Thine `are' the heavens -- the earth also `is' Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, Thou hast founded them. 
012 North and south Thou hast appointed them, Tabor and Hermon in Thy name do sing.  
013 Thou hast an arm with might, Strong is Thy hand -- high Thy right hand.  
014 Righteousness and judgment `Are' the fixed place of Thy throne, Kindness and truth go before Thy face. 
015 O the happiness of the people knowing the shout, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face they walk habitually.  
016 In Thy name they rejoice all the day, And in Thy righteousness they are exalted,  
017 For the beauty of their strength `art' Thou, And in Thy good will is our horn exalted, 
018 For of Jehovah `is' our shield, And of the Holy One of Israel our king. 
019 Then Thou hast spoken in vision, To Thy saint, yea, Thou sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a chosen one out of the people,  
020 I have found David My servant, With My holy oil I have anointed him.  
021 With whom My hand is established, My arm also doth strengthen him.  
022 An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a son of perverseness afflicteth him not.  
023 And I have beaten down before him his adversaries, And those hating him I plague,  
024 And My faithfulness and kindness `are' with him, And in My name is his horn exalted. 
025 And I have set on the sea his hand, And on the rivers his right hand.  
026 He proclaimeth me: `Thou `art' my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.' 
027 I also first-born do appoint him, Highest of the kings of the earth.  
028 To the age I keep for him My kindness, And My covenant `is' stedfast with him. 
029 And I have set his seed for ever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.  
030 If his sons forsake My law, And in My judgments do not walk;  
031 If My statutes they pollute, And My commands do not keep,  
032 I have looked after with a rod their transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,  
033 And My kindness I break not from him, Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.  
034 I profane not My covenant, And that which is going forth from My lips I change not.  
035 Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie not to David,  
036 His seed is to the age, And his throne `is' as the sun before Me, 
037 As the moon it is established -- to the age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.  
038 And Thou, Thou hast cast off, and dost reject, Thou hast shown Thyself wroth With Thine anointed,  
039 Hast rejected the covenant of Thy servant, Thou hast polluted to the earth his crown,  
040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges, Thou hast made his fenced places a ruin.  
041 Spoiled him have all passing by the way, He hath been a reproach to his neighbours,  
042 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries, Thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.  
043 Also -- Thou turnest back the sharpness of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,  
044 Hast caused `him' to cease from his brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down. 
045 Thou hast shortened the days of his youth, Hast covered him over `with' shame. Selah. 
046 Till when, O Jehovah, art Thou hidden? For ever doth Thy fury burn as fire?  
047 Remember, I pray Thee, what `is' life-time? Wherefore in vain hast Thou created All the sons of men? 
048 Who `is' the man that liveth, and doth not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah. 
049 Where `are' Thy former kindnesses, O Lord. Thou hast sworn to David in Thy faithfulness, 
050 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,  
051 Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.  
052 Blessed `is' Jehovah to the age. Amen, and amen!
