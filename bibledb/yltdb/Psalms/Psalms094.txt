001 God of vengeance -- Jehovah! God of vengeance, shine forth.  
002 Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud. 
003 Till when `do' the wicked, O Jehovah? Till when do the wicked exult? 
004 They utter -- they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.  
005 Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.  
006 Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.  
007 And they say, `Jehovah doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.'  
008 Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?  
009 He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?  
010 He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge `is' Jehovah. 
011 He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they `are' vanity. 
012 O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,  
013 To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.  
014 For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.  
015 For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,  
016 Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?  
017 Unless Jehovah `were' a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence. 
018 If I have said, `My foot hath slipped,' Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.  
019 In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.  
020 Is a throne of mischief joined `with' Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute? 
021 They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.  
022 And Jehovah is for a high place to me, And my God `is' for a rock -- my refuge, 
023 And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth cut them off!
