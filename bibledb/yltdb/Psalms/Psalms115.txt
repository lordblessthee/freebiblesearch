001 Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.  
002 Why do the nations say, `Where, pray, `is' their God. 
003 And our God `is' in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done. 
004 Their idols `are' silver and gold, work of man's hands, 
005 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,  
006 Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,  
007 Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;  
008 Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.  
009 O Israel, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.' 
010 O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.' 
011 Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.' 
012 Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,  
013 He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.  
014 Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.  
015 Blessed `are' ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth, 
016 The heavens -- the heavens `are' Jehovah's, And the earth He hath given to sons of men, 
017 The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.  
018 And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!
