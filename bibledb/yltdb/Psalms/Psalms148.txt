001 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, Praise ye Him in high places.  
002 Praise ye Him, all His messengers, Praise ye Him, all His hosts.  
003 Praise ye Him, sun and moon, Praise ye Him, all stars of light.  
004 Praise ye Him, heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.  
005 They do praise the name of Jehovah, For He commanded, and they were created.  
006 And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.  
007 Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,  
008 Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;  
009 The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,  
010 The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,  
011 Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,  
012 Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,  
013 They praise the name of Jehovah, For His name alone hath been set on high, His honour `is' above earth and heavens. 
014 And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise ye Jah!
