001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,  
002 He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,  
003 He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.  
004 He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.  
005 We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.  
006 Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.  
007 Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.  
008 They -- they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.  
009 O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!
