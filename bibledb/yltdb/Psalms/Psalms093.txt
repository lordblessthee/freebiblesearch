001 Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also -- established is the world, unmoved.  
002 Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou `art'. 
003 Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.  
004 Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high `is' Jehovah, 
005 Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely `is' holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!
