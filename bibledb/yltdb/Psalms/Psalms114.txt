001 In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,  
002 Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.  
003 The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.  
004 The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.  
005 What -- to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!  
006 O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!  
007 From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob, 
008 He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!
