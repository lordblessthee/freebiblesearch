001 To the Overseer, `Concerning the Inheritances.' -- A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.  
002 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.  
003 Jehovah, `at' morning Thou hearest my voice, `At' morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out. 
004 For not a God desiring wickedness `art' Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not. 
005 The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.  
006 Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.  
007 And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.  
008 O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,  
009 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart `is' mischiefs, An open grave `is' their throat, Their tongue they make smooth. 
010 Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.  
011 And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in Thee.  
012 For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!
