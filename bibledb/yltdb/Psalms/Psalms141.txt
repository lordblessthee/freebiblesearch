001 A Psalm, by David. O Jehovah, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear `to' my voice when I call to Thee. 
002 My prayer is prepared -- incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands -- the evening present.  
003 Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.  
004 Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.  
005 The righteous doth beat me `in' kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer `is' about their vexations. 
006 Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.  
007 As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.  
008 But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord, `are' mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul. 
009 Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.  
010 The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!
