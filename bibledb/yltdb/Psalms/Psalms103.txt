001 By David. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts -- His Holy Name.  
002 Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,  
003 Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,  
004 Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee -- kindness and mercies,  
005 Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.  
006 Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.  
007 He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.  
008 Merciful and gracious `is' Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy. 
009 Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.  
010 Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.  
011 For, as the height of the heavens `is' above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him. 
012 As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.  
013 As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.  
014 For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we `are' dust. 
015 Mortal man! as grass `are' his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth; 
016 For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.  
017 And the kindness of Jehovah `Is' from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons, 
018 To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.  
019 Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.  
020 Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power -- doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.  
021 Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers -- doing His pleasure.  
022 Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!
