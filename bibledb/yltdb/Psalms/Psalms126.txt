001 A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's turning back `to' the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers. 
002 Then filled `with' laughter is our mouth, And our tongue `with' singing, Then do they say among nations, `Jehovah did great things with these.' 
003 Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.  
004 Turn again, O Jehovah, `to' our captivity, As streams in the south. 
005 Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,  
006 Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!
