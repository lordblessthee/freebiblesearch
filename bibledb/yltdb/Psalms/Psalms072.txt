001 By Solomon. O God, Thy judgments to the king give, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.  
002 He judgeth Thy people with righteousness, And Thy poor with judgment.  
003 The mountains bear peace to the people, And the heights by righteousness.  
004 He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.  
005 They fear Thee with the sun, and before the moon, Generation -- generations.  
006 He cometh down as rain on mown grass, As showers -- sprinkling the earth.  
007 Flourish in his days doth the righteous, And abundance of peace till the moon is not.  
008 And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.  
009 Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.  
010 Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.  
011 And all kings do bow themselves to him, All nations do serve him,  
012 For he delivereth the needy who crieth, And the poor when he hath no helper,  
013 He hath pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he saveth,  
014 From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.  
015 And he liveth, and giveth to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he doth bless him.  
016 There is a handful of corn in the earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon doth its fruit, And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.  
017 His name is to the age, Before the sun is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do pronounce him happy.  
018 Blessed is Jehovah God, God of Israel, He alone is doing wonders,  
019 And blessed `is' the Name of His honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled `with' His honour. Amen, and amen! 
020 The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
