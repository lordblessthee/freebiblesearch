001 Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,  
002 Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.  
003 Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.  
004 The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. `God is not!' `are' all his devices. 
005 Pain do his ways at all times, On high `are' Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them. 
006 He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.  
007 Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue `is' perverseness and iniquity, 
008 He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,  
009 He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.  
010 He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.  
011 He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'  
012 Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.  
013 Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, `It is not required.'  
014 Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave `it', Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper. 
015 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;  
016 Jehovah `is' king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land! 
017 The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,  
018 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!
