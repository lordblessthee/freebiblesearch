001 A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?  
002 My help `is' from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth, 
003 He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.  
004 Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.  
005 Jehovah `is' thy preserver, Jehovah `is' thy shade on thy right hand, 
006 By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.  
007 Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.  
008 Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
