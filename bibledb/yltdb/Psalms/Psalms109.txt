001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent,  
002 For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me -- A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!  
003 They have compassed me about, And they fight me without cause.  
004 For my love they oppose me, and I -- prayer!  
005 And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my love.  
006 Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And an adversary standeth at his right hand.  
007 In his being judged, he goeth forth wicked, And his prayer is for sin.  
008 His days are few, his oversight another taketh,  
009 His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.  
010 And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.  
011 An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath, And strangers spoil his labour.  
012 He hath none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing favour to his orphans.  
013 His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation is their name blotted out.  
014 The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.  
015 They are before Jehovah continually, And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.  
016 Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart -- to slay,  
017 And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he hath not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.  
018 And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.  
019 It is to him as apparel -- he covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.  
020 This `is' the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah, And of those speaking evil against my soul. 
021 And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with me for Thy name's sake, Because Thy kindness `is' good, deliver me. 
022 For I `am' poor and needy, And my heart hath been pierced in my midst. 
023 As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.  
024 My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh hath failed of fatness.  
025 And I -- I have been a reproach to them, They see me, they shake their head.  
026 Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me, according to Thy kindness.  
027 And they know that this `is' Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it. 
028 They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.  
029 Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe `is' their shame. 
030 I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth, And in the midst of many I praise Him,  
031 For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save from those judging his soul.
