001 A Psalm. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm.  
002 Jehovah hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,  
003 He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.  
004 Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.  
005 Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,  
006 With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Jehovah.  
007 Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.  
008 Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,  
009 Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!
