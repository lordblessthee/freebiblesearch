001 By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise `is' in my mouth. 
002 In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.  
003 Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.  
004 I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.  
005 They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.  
006 This poor `one' called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him. 
007 A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.  
008 Taste ye and see that Jehovah `is' good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him. 
009 Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.  
010 Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,  
011 Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.  
012 Who `is' the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good? 
013 Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.  
014 Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.  
015 The eyes of Jehovah `are' unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry. 
016 (The face of Jehovah `is' on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.) 
017 They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.  
018 Near `is' Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth. 
019 Many `are' the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him. 
020 He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.  
021 Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.  
022 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
