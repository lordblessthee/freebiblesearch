001 A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, a habitation Thou -- Thou hast been, To us -- in generation and generation,  
002 Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou `art' God. 
003 Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men.  
004 For a thousand years in Thine eyes `are' as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night. 
005 Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.  
006 In the morning it flourisheth, and hath changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered.  
007 For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we have been troubled.  
008 Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things at the light of Thy face,  
009 For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation.  
010 Days of our years, in them `are' seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet `is' their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly away. 
011 Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear -- Thy wrath?  
012 To number our days aright let `us' know, And we bring the heart to wisdom. 
013 Turn back, O Jehovah, till when? And repent concerning Thy servants.  
014 Satisfy us at morn `with' Thy kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days. 
015 Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.  
016 Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thine honour on their sons.  
017 And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!
