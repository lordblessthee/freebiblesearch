001 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm by David. Jehovah, Thou hast searched me, and knowest.  
002 Thou -- Thou hast known my sitting down, And my rising up, Thou hast attended to my thoughts from afar.  
003 My path and my couch Thou hast fanned, And `with' all my ways hast been acquainted. 
004 For there is not a word in my tongue, Lo, O Jehovah, Thou hast known it all!  
005 Behind and before Thou hast besieged me, And Thou dost place on me Thy hand.  
006 Knowledge too wonderful for me, It hath been set on high, I am not able for it.  
007 Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And whither from Thy face do I flee?  
008 If I ascend the heavens -- there Thou `art', And spread out a couch in Sheol, lo, Thee! 
009 I take the wings of morning, I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,  
010 Also there Thy hand doth lead me, And Thy right hand doth hold me.  
011 And I say, `Surely darkness bruiseth me, Then night `is' light to me. 
012 Also darkness hideth not from Thee, And night as day shineth, as `is' darkness so `is' light. 
013 For Thou -- Thou hast possessed my reins, Thou dost cover me in my mother's belly.  
014 I confess Thee, because that `with' wonders I have been distinguished. Wonderful `are' Thy works, And my soul is knowing `it' well. 
015 My substance was not hid from Thee, When I was made in secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.  
016 Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw, And on Thy book all of them are written, The days they were formed -- And not one among them.  
017 And to me how precious have been Thy thoughts, O God, how great hath been their sum!  
018 I recount them! than the sand they are more, I have waked, and I am still with Thee.  
019 Dost Thou slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!  
020 Who exchange Thee for wickedness, Lifted up to vanity `are' Thine enemies. 
021 Do not I hate, Jehovah, those hating Thee? And with Thy withstanders grieve myself?  
022 `With' perfect hatred I have hated them, Enemies they have become to me. 
023 Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts,  
024 And see if a grievous way be in me, And lead me in a way age-during!
