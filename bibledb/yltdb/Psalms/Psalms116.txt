001 I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,  
002 Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.  
003 Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.  
004 And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,  
005 Gracious `is' Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God `is' merciful, 
006 A preserver of the simple `is' Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation. 
007 Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.  
008 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.  
009 I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.  
010 I have believed, for I speak, I -- I have been afflicted greatly.  
011 I said in my haste, `Every man `is' a liar.' 
012 What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits `are' upon me. 
013 The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.  
014 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.  
015 Precious in the eyes of Jehovah `is' the death for His saints. 
016 Cause `it' to come, O Jehovah, for I `am' Thy servant. I `am' Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds. 
017 To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.  
018 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,  
019 In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!
