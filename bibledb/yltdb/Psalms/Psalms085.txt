001 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Thou hast accepted, O Jehovah, Thy land, Thou hast turned `to' the captivity of Jacob. 
002 Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.  
003 Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath, Thou hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger.  
004 Turn back `to' us, O God of our salvation, And make void Thine anger with us. 
005 To the age art Thou angry against us? Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?  
006 Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest us, And Thy people do rejoice in Thee.  
007 Show us, O Jehovah, thy kindness, And Thy salvation Thou dost give to us.  
008 I hear what God Jehovah speaketh, For He speaketh peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not back to folly.  
009 Only, near to those fearing Him `is' His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land. 
010 Kindness and truth have met, Righteousness and peace have kissed,  
011 Truth from the earth springeth up, And righteousness from heaven looketh out,  
012 Jehovah also giveth that which is good, And our land doth give its increase.  
013 Righteousness before Him goeth, And maketh His footsteps for a way!
