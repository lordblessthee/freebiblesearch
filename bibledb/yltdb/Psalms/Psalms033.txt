001 Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For upright ones praise `is' comely. 
002 Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,  
003 Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.  
004 For upright `is' the word of Jehovah, And all His work `is' in faithfulness. 
005 Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.  
006 By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.  
007 Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.  
008 Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.  
009 For He hath said, and it is, He hath commanded, and it standeth.  
010 Jehovah made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.  
011 The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.  
012 O the happiness of the nation whose God `is' Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him. 
013 From the heavens hath Jehovah looked, He hath seen all the sons of men.  
014 From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;  
015 Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.  
016 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.  
017 A false thing `is' the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver. 
018 Lo, the eye of Jehovah `is' to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness, 
019 To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.  
020 Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our help and our shield `is' He, 
021 For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted. 
022 Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
