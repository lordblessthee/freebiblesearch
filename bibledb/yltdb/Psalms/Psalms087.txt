001 By sons of Korah. -- A Psalm, a song. His foundation `is' in holy mountains. 
002 Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.  
003 Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.  
004 I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This `one' was born there. 
005 And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.  
006 Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, `This `one' was born there.' Selah. 
007 Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains `are' in Thee!
