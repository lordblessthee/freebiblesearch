001 To the Overseer. -- A Song, a Psalm. Shout ye to God, all the earth.  
002 Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise.  
003 Say to God, `How fearful `are' Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee. 
004 All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah.  
005 Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.  
006 He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.  
007 Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.  
008 Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,  
009 Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.  
010 For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver.  
011 Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins.  
012 Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place.  
013 I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,  
014 For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:  
015 `Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah.  
016 Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul. 
017 Unto Him `with' my mouth I have called, And exaltation `is' under my tongue. 
018 Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear.  
019 But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.  
020 Blessed `is' God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!
