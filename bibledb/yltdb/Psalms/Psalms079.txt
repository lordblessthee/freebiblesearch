001 A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have come into Thy inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made Jerusalem become heaps,  
002 They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild beast of the earth.  
003 They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.  
004 We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.  
005 Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy doth burn as fire.  
006 Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.  
007 For `one' hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have made desolate. 
008 Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste, let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.  
009 Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy name's sake. 
010 Why do the nations say, `Where `is' their God?' Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the blood of Thy servants that is shed. 
011 Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of death.  
012 And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.  
013 And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy praise!
