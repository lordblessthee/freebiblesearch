001 By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.  
002 Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified `are' my reins and my heart. 
003 For Thy kindness `is' before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth. 
004 I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.  
005 I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.  
006 I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.  
007 To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.  
008 Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.  
009 Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,  
010 In whose hand `is' a wicked device, And their right hand `is' full of bribes. 
011 And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.  
012 My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
