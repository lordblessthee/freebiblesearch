001 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,  
002 For Jehovah Most High `is' fearful, A great king over all the earth. 
003 He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.  
004 He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.  
005 God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.  
006 Praise God -- praise -- give praise to our king, praise.  
007 For king of all the earth `is' God, Give praise, O understanding one. 
008 God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,  
009 Nobles of peoples have been gathered, `With' the people of the God of Abraham, For to God `are' the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!
