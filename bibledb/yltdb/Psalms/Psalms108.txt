001 A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.  
002 Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.  
003 I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.  
004 For great above the heavens `is' Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth. 
005 Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.  
006 That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save `with' Thy right hand, and answer us. 
007 God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,  
008 Mine `is' Gilead, mine `is' Manasseh, And Ephraim `is' the strength of my head, Judah `is' my lawgiver, 
009 Moab `is' a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually. 
010 Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?  
011 Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!  
012 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.  
013 In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!
