001 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Hear this, all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.  
002 Both low and high, together rich and needy.  
003 My mouth speaketh wise things, And the meditations of my heart `are' things of understanding. 
004 I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my riddle:  
005 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters doth compass me.  
006 Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.  
007 A brother doth no one at all ransom, He doth not give to God his atonement.  
008 And precious `is' the redemption of their soul, And it hath ceased -- to the age. 
009 And still he liveth for ever, He seeth not the pit.  
010 For he seeth wise men die, Together the foolish and brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.  
011 Their heart `is': Their houses `are' to the age, Their tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names over the lands. 
012 And man in honour doth not remain, He hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off.  
013 This their way `is' folly for them, And their posterity with their sayings are pleased. Selah. 
014 As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves, Death doth afflict them, And the upright rule over them in the morning, And their form `is' for consumption. Sheol `is' a dwelling for him. 
015 Only, God doth ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol, For He doth receive me. Selah.  
016 Fear not, when one maketh wealth, When the honour of his house is abundant,  
017 For at his death he receiveth nothing, His honour goeth not down after him.  
018 For his soul in his life he blesseth, (And they praise thee when thou dost well for thyself.)  
019 It cometh to the generation of his fathers, For ever they see not the light.  
020 Man in honour, who understandest not, Hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
