001 A Psalm. -- A Song for the sabbath-day. Good to give thanks to Jehovah, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High,  
002 To declare in the morning Thy kindness, And Thy faithfulness in the nights.  
003 On ten strings and on psaltery, On higgaion, with harp.  
004 For Thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Jehovah, in Thy work, Concerning the works of Thy hands I sing.  
005 How great have been Thy works, O Jehovah, Very deep have been Thy thoughts.  
006 A brutish man doth not know, And a fool understandeth not this; --  
007 When the wicked flourish as a herb, And blossom do all workers of iniquity -- For their being destroyed for ever and ever!  
008 And Thou `art' high to the age, O Jehovah. 
009 For, lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of iniquity.  
010 And Thou exaltest as a reem my horn, I have been anointed with fresh oil.  
011 And mine eye looketh on mine enemies, Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.  
012 The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.  
013 Those planted in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of our God do flourish.  
014 Still they bring forth in old age, Fat and flourishing are they,  
015 To declare that upright `is' Jehovah my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!
