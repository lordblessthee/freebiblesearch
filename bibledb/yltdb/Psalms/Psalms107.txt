001 `Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age `is' His kindness:' 
002 Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.  
003 And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.  
004 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.  
005 Hungry -- yea -- thirsty, Their soul in them becometh feeble,  
006 And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,  
007 And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.  
008 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.  
009 For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul hath filled `with' goodness. 
010 Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,  
011 Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.  
012 And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.  
013 And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.  
014 He bringeth them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.  
015 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.  
016 For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He hath cut.  
017 Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.  
018 All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,  
019 And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,  
020 He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.  
021 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,  
022 And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.  
023 Those going down `to' the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters, 
024 They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in the deep.  
025 And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,  
026 They go up `to' the heavens, they go down `to' the depths, Their soul in evil is melted. 
027 They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.  
028 And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.  
029 He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.  
030 And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.  
031 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,  
032 And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.  
033 He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.  
034 A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.  
035 He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.  
036 And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.  
037 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.  
038 And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.  
039 And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.  
040 He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to wander in vacancy -- no way.  
041 And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.  
042 The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath shut her mouth.  
043 Who `is' wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!
