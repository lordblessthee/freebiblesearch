001 A Song, -- A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.  
002 For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head,  
003 Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones.  
004 They have said, `Come, And we cut them off from `being' a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.' 
005 For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make,  
006 Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,  
007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,  
008 Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.  
009 Do to them as `to' Midian, As `to' Sisera, as `to' Jabin, at the stream Kishon. 
010 They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground!  
011 Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,  
012 Who have said, `Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.'  
013 O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind.  
014 As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire,  
015 So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them.  
016 Fill their faces `with' shame, And they seek Thy name, O Jehovah. 
017 They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost.  
018 And they know that Thou -- (Thy name `is' Jehovah -- by Thyself,) `Art' the Most High over all the earth!
