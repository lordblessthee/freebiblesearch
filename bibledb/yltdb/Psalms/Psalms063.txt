001 A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou `art' my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters. 
002 So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour.  
003 Because better `is' Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee. 
004 So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands.  
005 As `with' milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And `with' singing lips doth my mouth praise. 
006 If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches -- I meditate on Thee.  
007 For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing.  
008 Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold.  
009 And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.  
010 They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.  
011 And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!
