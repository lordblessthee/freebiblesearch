001 A Song of the Ascents. Unto Jehovah in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.  
002 O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!  
003 What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!  
004 Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.  
005 Wo to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.  
006 Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.  
007 I `am' peace, and when I speak they `are' for war!
