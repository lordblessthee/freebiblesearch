001 To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of Asaph. My voice `is' to God, and I cry, my voice `is' to God, And He hath given ear unto me. 
002 In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My soul hath refused to be comforted.  
003 I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.  
004 Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.  
005 I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.  
006 I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate, and my spirit doth search diligently:  
007 To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?  
008 Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?  
009 Hath God forgotten `His' favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah. 
010 And I say: `My weakness is, The changes of the right hand of the Most High.'  
011 I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Thy wonders,  
012 And I have meditated on all Thy working, And I talk concerning Thy doings.  
013 O God, in holiness `is' Thy way, Who `is' a great god like God? 
014 Thou `art' the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength, 
015 Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.  
016 The waters have seen Thee, O God, The waters have seen Thee, They are afraid -- also depths are troubled.  
017 Poured out waters have thick clouds, The skies have given forth a noise, Also -- Thine arrows go up and down.  
018 The voice of Thy thunder `is' in the spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth hath trembled, yea, it shaketh. 
019 In the sea `is' Thy way, And Thy paths `are' in many waters, And Thy tracks have not been known. 
020 Thou hast led as a flock Thy people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
