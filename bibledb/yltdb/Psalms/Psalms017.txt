001 A Prayer of David. Hear, O Jehovah, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear `to' my prayer, without lips of deceit. 
002 From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.  
003 Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.  
004 As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;  
005 To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden.  
006 I -- I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.  
007 Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.  
008 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.  
009 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.  
010 Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:  
011 `Our steps now have compassed `him';' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land. 
012 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.  
013 Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,  
014 From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, their portion `is' in life, And `with' Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied `with' sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings. 
015 I -- in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking, `with' Thy form!
