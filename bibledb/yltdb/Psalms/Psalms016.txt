001 A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.  
002 Thou hast said to Jehovah, `My Lord Thou `art';' My good `is' not for thine own sake; 
003 For the holy ones who `are' in the land, And the honourable, all my delight `is' in them. 
004 Multiplied are their griefs, `Who' have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips. 
005 Jehovah `is' the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou -- Thou dost uphold my lot. 
006 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance `is' for me. 
007 I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also `in' the nights my reins instruct me. 
008 I did place Jehovah before me continually, Because -- at my right hand I am not moved.  
009 Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:  
010 For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.  
011 Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys `is' with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!
