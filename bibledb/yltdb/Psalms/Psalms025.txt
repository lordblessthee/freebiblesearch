001 By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I lift up.  
002 My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.  
003 Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.  
004 Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know, Thy paths teach Thou me.  
005 Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach me, For Thou `art' the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day. 
006 Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy kindnesses, for from the age `are' they. 
007 Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.  
008 Good and upright `is' Jehovah, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way. 
009 He causeth the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.  
010 All the paths of Jehovah `are' kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies. 
011 For Thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Thou hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it `is' great. 
012 Who `is' this -- the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose. 
013 His soul in good doth remain, And his seed doth possess the land. 
014 The secret of Jehovah `is' for those fearing Him, And His covenant -- to cause them to know. 
015 Mine eyes `are' continually unto Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet. 
016 Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted `am' I. 
017 The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.  
018 See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.  
019 See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.  
020 Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.  
021 Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited `on' Thee. 
022 Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
