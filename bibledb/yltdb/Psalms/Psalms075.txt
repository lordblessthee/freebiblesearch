001 To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. We have given thanks to Thee, O God, We have given thanks, and near `is' Thy name, They have recounted Thy wonders. 
002 When I receive an appointment, I -- I do judge uprightly.  
003 Melted is the earth and all its inhabitants, I -- I have pondered its pillars. Selah.  
004 I have said to the boastful, `Be not boastful,' And to the wicked, `Raise not up a horn.'  
005 Raise not up on high your horn, (Ye speak with a stiff neck.)  
006 For not from the east, or from the west, Nor from the wilderness -- `is' elevation. 
007 But God `is' judge, This He maketh low -- and this He lifteth up. 
008 For a cup `is' in the hand of Jehovah, And the wine hath foamed, It is full of mixture, and He poureth out of it, Only its dregs wring out, and drink, Do all the wicked of the earth, 
009 And I -- I declare `it' to the age, I sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
010 And all horns of the wicked I cut off, Exalted are the horns of the righteous!
