001 A Song of the Ascents. Remember, Jehovah, for David, all his afflictions.  
002 Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:  
003 `If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,  
004 If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids -- slumber,  
005 Till I do find a place for Jehovah, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.  
006 `Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest.  
007 We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool.  
008 Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength,  
009 Thy priests do put on righteousness, And Thy pious ones cry aloud.  
010 For the sake of David Thy servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.  
011 Jehovah hath sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne for thee.  
012 If thy sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for thee.  
013 For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion, He hath desired `it' for a seat to Himself, 
014 This `is' My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it. 
015 Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy `with' bread, 
016 And her priests I clothe `with' salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud. 
017 There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.  
018 His enemies I do clothe `with' shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!
