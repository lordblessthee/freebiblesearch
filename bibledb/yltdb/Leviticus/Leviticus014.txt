001 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,  
002 `This is a law of the leper, in the day of his cleansing, that he hath been brought in unto the priest,  
003 and the priest hath gone out unto the outside of the camp, and the priest hath seen, and lo, the plague of leprosy hath ceased from the leper,  
004 and the priest hath commanded, and he hath taken for him who is to be cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.  
005 `And the priest hath commanded, and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;  
006 `as to' the living bird, he taketh it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and hath dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, over the running water, 
007 and he hath sprinkled on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and hath pronounced him clean, and hath sent out the living bird on the face of the field.  
008 `And he who is to be cleansed hath washed his garments, and hath shaved all his hair, and hath bathed with water, and hath been clean, and afterwards he doth come in unto the camp, and hath dwelt at the outside of his tent seven days.  
009 `And it hath been, on the seventh day -- he shaveth all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair he doth shave, and he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and hath been clean.  
010 `And on the eighth day he taketh two lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe-lamb, daughter of a year, a perfect one, and three tenth deals of flour `for' a present, mixed with oil, and one log of oil. 
011 `And the priest who is cleansing hath caused the man who is to be cleansed to stand with them before Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting,  
012 and the priest hath taken the one he-lamb, and hath brought it near for a guilt-offering, also the log of oil, and hath waved them -- a wave offering before Jehovah.  
013 `And he hath slaughtered the lamb in the place where he slaughtereth the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy place; for like the sin-offering the guilt-offering is to the priest; it `is' most holy. 
014 `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;  
015 and the priest hath taken of the log of oil, and hath poured on the left palm of the priest,  
016 and the priest hath dipped his right finger in the oil which `is' on his left palm, and hath sprinkled of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah. 
017 `And of the residue of the oil which `is' on his palm, the priest putteth on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt-offering; 
018 and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest, he putteth on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah. 
019 `And the priest hath made the sin-offering, and hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterwards he doth slaughter the burnt-offering;  
020 and the priest hath caused the burnt-offering to ascend, also the present, on the altar, and the priest hath made atonement for him, and he hath been clean.  
021 `And if he `is' poor, and his hand is not reaching `these things', then he hath taken one lamb -- a guilt-offering, for a wave-offering, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth deal of flour mixed with oil for a present, and a log of oil, 
022 and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, which his hand reacheth to, and one hath been a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering;  
023 and he hath brought them in on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah.  
024 `And the priest hath taken the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest hath waved them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah;  
025 and he hath slaughtered the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;  
026 and the priest doth pour of the oil on the left palm of the priest;  
027 and the priest hath sprinkled with his right finger of the oil which `is' on his left palm, seven times before Jehovah. 
028 `And the priest hath put of the oil which `is' on his palm, on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt-offering; 
029 and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest he doth put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him, before Jehovah. 
030 `And he hath made the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons (from that which his hand reacheth to,  
031 `even' that which his hand reacheth to), the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt offering, besides the present, and the priest hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Jehovah. 
032 This `is' a law of him in whom `is' a plague of leprosy, whose hand reacheth not to his cleansing.' 
033 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,  
034 `When ye come in unto the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you for a possession, and I have put a plague of leprosy in a house `in' the land of your possession; 
035 then hath he whose the house `is' come in and declared to the priest, saying, As a plague hath appeared to me in the house; 
036 and the priest hath commanded, and they have prepared the house before the priest cometh in to see the plague (that all which `is' in the house be not unclean), and afterwards doth the priest come in to see the house; 
037 and he hath seen the plague, and lo, the plague `is' in the walls of the house, hollow strakes, very green or very red, and their appearance `is' lower than the wall, 
038 and the priest hath gone out of the house unto the opening of the house, and hath shut up the house seven days.  
039 `And the priest hath turned back on the seventh day, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the walls of the house,  
040 and the priest hath commanded, and they have drawn out the stones in which the plague `is', and have cast them unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place; 
041 and the house he doth cause to be scraped within round about, and they have poured out the clay which they have scraped off, at the outside of the city, at an unclean place;  
042 and they have taken other stones, and brought `them' in unto the place of the stones, and other clay he taketh and hath daubed the house. 
043 `And if the plague return, and hath broken out in the house, after he hath drawn out the stones, and after the scraping of the house, and after the daubing;  
044 then hath the priest come in and seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the house; it `is' a fretting leprosy in the house; it `is' unclean. 
045 `And he hath broken down the house, its stones, and its wood, and all the clay of the house, and he hath brought `them' forth unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place. 
046 `And he who is going in unto the house all the days he hath shut it up, is unclean till the evening;  
047 and he who is lying in the house doth wash his garments; and he who is eating in the house doth wash his garments.  
048 `And if the priest certainly come in, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath not spread in the house after the daubing of the house, then hath the priest pronounced the house clean, for the plague hath been healed.  
049 `And he hath taken for the cleansing of the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;  
050 and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;  
051 and he hath taken the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and hath dipped them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the running water, and hath sprinkled upon the house seven times.  
052 `And he hath cleansed the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;  
053 and he hath sent away the living bird unto the outside of the city unto the face of the field, and hath made atonement for the house, and it hath been clean.  
054 `This `is' the law for every plague of the leprosy and for scall, 
055 and for leprosy of a garment, and of a house,  
056 and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot, --  
057 to direct in the day of being unclean, and in the day of being clean; this `is' the law of the leprosy.'
