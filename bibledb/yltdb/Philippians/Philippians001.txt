001 Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministrants;  
002 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
003 I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,  
004 always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,  
005 for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,  
006 having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform `it' till a day of Jesus Christ, 
007 according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and `in' the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace. 
008 For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,  
009 and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,  
010 for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,  
011 being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that `is' through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 
012 And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,  
013 so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,  
014 and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.  
015 Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;  
016 the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,  
017 and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:  
018 what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.  
019 For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,  
020 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,  
021 for to me to live `is' Christ, and to die gain. 
022 And if to live in the flesh `is' to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not; 
023 for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,  
024 and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,  
025 and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,  
026 that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.  
027 Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,  
028 and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;  
029 because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;  
030 the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me.
