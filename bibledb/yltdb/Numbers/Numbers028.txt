001 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,  
002 `Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season.  
003 `And thou hast said to them, This `is' the fire-offering which ye bring near to Jehovah: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering; 
004 the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;  
005 and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;  
006 a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;  
007 and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Jehovah.  
008 `And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest -- a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.  
009 `And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;  
010 the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation.  
011 `And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;  
012 and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;  
013 and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;  
014 and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this `is' the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year; 
015 and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation.  
016 `And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, `is' the passover to Jehovah; 
017 and in the fifteenth day of this month `is' a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten; 
018 in the first day `is' an holy convocation, ye do no servile work, 
019 and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;  
020 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;  
021 a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,  
022 and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.  
023 `Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which `is' for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these; 
024 according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;  
025 and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work.  
026 `And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Jehovah, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;  
027 and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,  
028 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,  
029 a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;  
030 one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;  
031 apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare `them' (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations.
