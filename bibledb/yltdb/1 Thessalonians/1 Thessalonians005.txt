001 And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,  
002 for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,  
003 for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail `doth' her who is with child, and they shall not escape; 
004 and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;  
005 all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,  
006 so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,  
007 for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,  
008 and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of salvation,  
009 because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
010 who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;  
011 wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.  
012 And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,  
013 and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;  
014 and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;  
015 see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;  
016 always rejoice ye;  
017 continually pray ye;  
018 in every thing give thanks, for this `is' the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you. 
019 The Spirit quench not;  
020 prophesyings despise not;  
021 all things prove; that which is good hold fast;  
022 from all appearance of evil abstain ye;  
023 and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;  
024 stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do `it'. 
025 Brethren, pray for us;  
026 salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;  
027 I charge you `by' the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren; 
028 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you! Amen.
