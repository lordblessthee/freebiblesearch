001 We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,  
002 for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,  
003 for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,  
004 for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh `day' thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;' 
005 and in this `place' again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' 
006 since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --  
007 again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'  
008 for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;  
009 there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,  
010 for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.  
011 May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,  
012 for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;  
013 and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things `are' naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning. 
014 Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,  
015 for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but `one' tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin; 
016 we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.
