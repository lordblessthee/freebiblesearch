001 Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,  
002 of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,  
003 and this we will do, if God may permit,  
004 for `it is' impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit, 
005 and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,  
006 and having fallen away, again to renew `them' to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame. 
007 For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,  
008 and that which is bearing thorns and briers `is' disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end `is' for burning; 
009 and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,  
010 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;  
011 and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,  
012 that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises.  
013 For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,  
014 saying, `Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;'  
015 and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;  
016 for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation `is' the oath, 
017 in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,  
018 that through two immutable things, in which `it is' impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before `us', 
019 which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,  
020 whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.
