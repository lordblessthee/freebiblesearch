001 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,  
002 being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,  
003 for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,  
004 for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build `is' God, 
005 and Moses indeed `was' stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken, 
006 and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.  
007 Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear --  
008 ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,  
009 in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;  
010 wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;  
011 so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')  
012 See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,  
013 but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,  
014 for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,  
015 in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'  
016 for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;  
017 but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?  
018 and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --  
019 and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
