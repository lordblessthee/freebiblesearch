001 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,  
002 and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:  
003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!  
004 I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,  
005 hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,  
006 that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that `is' in you toward Christ Jesus; 
007 for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.  
008 Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit --  
009 because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;  
010 I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,  
011 who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,  
012 whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,  
013 whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,  
014 and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,  
015 for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,  
016 no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!  
017 If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,  
018 and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;  
019 I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.  
020 Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;  
021 having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;  
022 and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.  
023 Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)  
024 Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!  
025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with your spirit! Amen.
