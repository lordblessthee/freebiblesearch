001 Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, 
002 who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. 
003 For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses- as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. 
004 (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) 
005 Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, 
006 but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. 
007 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, `Today, if you hear his voice, 
008 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, 
009 where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works 
010 for forty years. Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, 'They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.' 
011 As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest.'` 
012 Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. 
013 But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called `today,` that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
014 For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. 
015 As it is said, `Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.` 
016 For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? 
017 And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
018 And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? 
019 So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
