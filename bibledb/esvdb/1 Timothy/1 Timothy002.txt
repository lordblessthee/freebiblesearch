001 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 
002 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. 
003 This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 
004 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
005 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
006 who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. 
007 For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
008 I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; 
009 likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, 
010 but with what is proper for women who profess godliness- with good works. 
011 Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. 
012 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. 
013 For Adam was formed first, then Eve; 
014 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. 
015 Yet she will be saved through childbearing- if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.
