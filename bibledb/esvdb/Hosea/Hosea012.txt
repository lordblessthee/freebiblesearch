001 Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt. 
002 The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him according to his deeds. 
003 In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he strove with God.

005 the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name: 
006 `So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God.` 
007 A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress. 
008 Ephraim has said, `Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin.` 
009 I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast. 
010 I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables. 
011 If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing: in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field. 
012 Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep. 
013 By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded. 
014 Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.
