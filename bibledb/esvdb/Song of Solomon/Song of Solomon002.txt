001 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 
002 As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women. 
003 As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste, 
004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. 
005 Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love. 
006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me! 
007 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases. 
008 The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills. 
009 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice. 
010 My beloved speaks and says to me: `Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away, 
011 for behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone. 
012 The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 
013 The fig tree ripens its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. 
014 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 
015 Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom.` 
016 My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes among the lilies. 
017 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on cleft mountains.
