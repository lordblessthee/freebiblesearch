001 The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. 
002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; 
003 your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you. 
004 Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you. 
005 I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 
006 Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept! 
007 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions? 
008 If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents. 
009 I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. 
010 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 
011 We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver. 
012 While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance. 
013 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts. 
014 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi. 
015 Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves. 
016 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green; 
017 the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.
