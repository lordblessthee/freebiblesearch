001 On my bed by nightI sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not. 
002 I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but found him not. 
003 The watchmen found me as they went about in the city. `Have you seen him whom my soul loves?` 
004 Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me. 
005 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.

007 Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men, some of the mighty men of Israel, 
008 all of them wearing swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against terror by night. 
009 King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon. 
010 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem. 
011 Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.
