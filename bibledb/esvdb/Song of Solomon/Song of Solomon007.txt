001 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand. 
002 Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies. 
003 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 
004 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus. 
005 Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses. 
006 How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights! 
007 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. 
008 I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples, 
009 and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth. 
010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me. 
011 Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages; 
012 let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 
013 The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
