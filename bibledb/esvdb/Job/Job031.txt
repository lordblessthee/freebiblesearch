001 `I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? 
002 What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high? 
003 Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity? 
004 Does not he see my ways and number all my steps? 
005 `If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit; 
006 (Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!) 
007 if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands, 
008 then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out. 
009 `If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door, 
010 then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her. 
011 For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; 
012 for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase. 
013 `If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me, 
014 what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him? 
015 Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb? 
016 `If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 
017 or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 
018 (for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow), 
019 if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering, 
020 if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 
021 if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, 
022 then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket. 
023 For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty. 
024 `If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence, 
025 if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much, 
026 if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor, 
027 and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand, 
028 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above. 
029 `If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook him 
030 (I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse), 
031 if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?' 
032 ( the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler), 
033 if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my bosom, 
034 because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors- 
035 Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary! 
036 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown; 
037 I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him. 
038 `If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together, 
039 if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last, 
040 let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley.` The words of Job are ended.
