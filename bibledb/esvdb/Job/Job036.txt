001 And Elihu continued, and said: 
002 `Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf. 
003 I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
004 For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 
005 `Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding. 
006 He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right. 
007 He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted. 
008 And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction, 
009 then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly. 
010 He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity. 
011 If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness. 
012 But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge. 
013 `The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them. 
014 They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes. 
015 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity. 
016 He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness. 
017 `But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you. 
018 Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside. 
019 Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength? 
020 Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place. 
021 Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction. 
022 Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him? 
023 Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'? 
024 `Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung. 
025 All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar. 
026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable. 
027 For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain, 
028 which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly. 
029 Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion? 
030 Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea. 
031 For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance. 
032 He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark. 
033 Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises.
