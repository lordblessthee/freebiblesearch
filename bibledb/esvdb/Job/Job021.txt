001 Then Job answered and said: 
002 `Keep listening to my words, and let this be your comfort. 
003 Bear with me, and I will speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. 
004 As for me, is my complaint against man? Why should I not be impatient? 
005 Look at me and be appalled, and lay your hand over your mouth. 
006 When I remember I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh. 
007 Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power? 
008 Their offspring are established in their presence, and their descendants before their eyes. 
009 Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them. 
010 Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry. 
011 They send out their little boys like a flock, and their children dance. 
012 They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. 
013 They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol. 
014 They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways. 
015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?' 
016 Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand? The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
017 `How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains in his anger? 
018 That they are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away? 
019 You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let him pay it out to them, that they may know it. 
020 Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
021 For what do they care for their houses after them, when the number of their months is cut off? 
022 Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those who are on high? 
023 One dies in his full vigor, being wholly at ease and secure, 
024 his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist. 
025 Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of prosperity. 
026 They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them. 
027 `Behold, I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me. 
028 For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' 
029 Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony 
030 that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity, that he is rescued in the day of wrath? 
031 Who declares his way to his face, and who repays him for what he has done? 
032 When he is carried to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. 
033 The clods of the valley are sweet to him; all mankind follows after him, and those who go before him are innumerable. 
034 How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood.`
