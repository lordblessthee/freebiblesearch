001 Then Job answered and said: 
002 `How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words? 
003 These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me? 
004 And even if it be true that I have erred, my error remains with myself. 
005 If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me, 
006 know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me. 
007 Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice. 
008 He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths. 
009 He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head. 
010 He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, and my hope has he pulled up like a tree. 
011 He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary. 
012 His troops come on together; they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 
013 `He has put my brothers far from me, and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me. 
014 My relatives have failed me, my close friends have forgotten me. 
015 The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 
016 I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy. 
017 My breath is strange to my wife, and I am a stench to the children of my own mother. 
018 Even young children despise me; when I rise they talk against me. 
019 All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me. 
020 My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 
021 Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! 
022 Why do you, like God, pursue me? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh? 
023 `Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! 
024 Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever! 
025 For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. 
026 And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God, 
027 whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me! 
028 If you say, 'How we will pursue him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him,' 
029 be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.`
