001 Then Job answered and said: 
002 `Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God? 
003 If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times. 
004 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength- who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?- 
005 he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger, 
006 who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble; 
007 who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars; 
008 who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea; 
009 who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south; 
010 who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number. 
011 Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him. 
012 Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?' 
013 `God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab. 
014 How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him? 
015 Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser. 
016 If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice. 
017 For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause; 
018 he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 
019 If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him? 
020 Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse. 
021 I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life. 
022 It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked. 
023 When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent. 
024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges- if it is not he, who then is it? 
025 `My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good. 
026 They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey. 
027 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,' 
028 I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent. 
029 I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain? 
030 If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, 
031 yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me. 
032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. 
033 There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both. 
034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me. 
035 Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself.
