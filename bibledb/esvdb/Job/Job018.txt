001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 
002 `How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak. 
003 Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight? 
004 You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? 
005 `Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine. 
006 The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. 
007 His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down. 
008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh. 
009 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him. 
010 A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path. 
011 Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels. 
012 His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling. 
013 It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 
014 He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors. 
015 In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation. 
016 His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above. 
017 His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street. 
018 He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world. 
019 He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live. 
020 They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east. 
021 Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God.`
