001 Then Job answered and said: 
002 `How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! 
003 How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 
004 With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you? 
005 The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants. 
006 Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 
007 He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. 
008 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them. 
009 He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud. 
010 He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 
011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke. 
012 By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. 
013 By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 
014 Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?`
