001 `Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord? 
002 Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 
003 Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak to you soft words? 
004 Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever? 
005 Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on a leash for your girls? 
006 Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 
007 Can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 
008 Lay your hands on him; remember the battle- you will not do it again! 
009 Behold, the hope of a man is false; he is laid low even at the sight of him. 
010 No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me? 
011 Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. 
012 `I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame. 
013 Who can strip off his outer garment? Who would come near him with a bridle? 
014 Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror. 
015 His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal. 
016 One is so near to another that no air can come between them. 
017 They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated. 
018 His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn. 
019 Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth. 
020 Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. 
021 His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth. 
022 In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. 
023 The folds of his flesh stick together, firmly cast on him and immovable. 
024 His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone. 
025 When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves. 
026 Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 
027 He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. 
028 The arrow cannot make him flee; for him sling stones are turned to stubble. 
029 Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins. 
030 His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire. 
031 He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 
032 Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired. 
033 On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear. 
034 He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride.`
