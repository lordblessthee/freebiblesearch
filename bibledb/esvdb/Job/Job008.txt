001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 
002 `How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind? 
003 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right? 
004 If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression. 
005 If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy, 
006 if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation. 
007 And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great. 
008 `For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out. 
009 For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow. 
010 Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding? 
011 `Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water? 
012 While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant. 
013 Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish. 
014 His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web. 
015 He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure. 
016 He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden. 
017 His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones. 
018 If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.' 
019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring. 
020 `Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers. 
021 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. 
022 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.`
