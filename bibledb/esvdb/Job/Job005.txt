001 `Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 
002 Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple. 
003 I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling. 
004 His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them. 
005 The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth. 
006 For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground, 
007 but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. 
008 `As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause, 
009 who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number: 
010 he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields; 
011 he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety. 
012 He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success. 
013 He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end. 
014 They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night. 
015 But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty. 
016 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 
017 `Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty. 
018 For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal. 
019 He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you. 
020 In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. 
021 You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes. 
022 At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth. 
023 For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 
024 You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing. 
025 You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth. 
026 You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season. 
027 Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good.`
