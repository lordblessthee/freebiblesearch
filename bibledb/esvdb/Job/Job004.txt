001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 
002 `If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking? 
003 Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. 
004 Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees. 
005 But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed. 
006 Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? 
007 `Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? 
008 As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. 
009 By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed. 
010 The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken. 
011 The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 
012 `Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it. 
013 Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 
014 dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 
015 A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 
016 It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice: 
017 'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? 
018 Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error; 
019 how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. 
020 Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it. 
021 Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'
