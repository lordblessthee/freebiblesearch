001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 
002 `Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven. 
003 Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise? 
004 How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure? 
005 Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes; 
006 how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!`
