001 `But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words. 
002 Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks. 
003 My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely. 
004 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 
005 Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand. 
006 Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay. 
007 Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you. 
008 `Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words. 
009 You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me. 
010 Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy, 
011 he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.' 
012 `Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man. 
013 Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'? 
014 For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it. 
015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds, 
016 then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings, 
017 that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man; 
018 he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. 
019 `Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones, 
020 so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food. 
021 His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. 
022 His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death. 
023 If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him, 
024 and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom; 
025 let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor'; 
026 then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness. 
027 He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me. 
028 He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.' 
029 `Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man, 
030 to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life. 
031 Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. 
032 If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you. 
033 If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.`
