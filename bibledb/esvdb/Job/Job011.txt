001 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 
002 `Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right? 
003 Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you? 
004 For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.' 
005 But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you, 
006 and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. 
007 `Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? 
008 It is higher than heaven- what can you do? Deeper than Sheol- what can you know? 
009 Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. 
010 If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back? 
011 For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it? 
012 But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man! 
013 `If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him. 
014 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents. 
015 Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear. 
016 You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away. 
017 And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning. 
018 And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security. 
019 You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor. 
020 But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last.`
