001 Then Job answered and said: 
002 `Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! 
003 For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash. 
004 For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me. 
005 Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder? 
006 Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow? 
007 My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me. 
008 `Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope, 
009 that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off! 
010 This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 
011 What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient? 
012 Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze? 
013 Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me? 
014 `He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 
015 My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away, 
016 which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself. 
017 When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place. 
018 The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish. 
019 The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope. 
020 They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed. 
021 For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid. 
022 Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'? 
023 Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'? 
024 `Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray. 
025 How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove? 
026 Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind? 
027 You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend. 
028 `But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face. 
029 Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake. 
030 Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?
