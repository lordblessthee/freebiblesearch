001 `Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does? 
002 Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth, 
003 when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young? 
004 Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them. 
005 `Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey, 
006 to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place? 
007 He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver. 
008 He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing. 
009 `Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger? 
010 Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you? 
011 Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor? 
012 Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor? 
013 `The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love? 
014 For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground, 
015 forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them. 
016 She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear, 
017 because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding. 
018 When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider. 
019 `Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? 
020 Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying. 
021 He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons. 
022 He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword. 
023 Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear and the javelin. 
024 With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet. 
025 When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
026 `Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south? 
027 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high? 
028 On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold. 
029 From there he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it afar off. 
030 His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he.`
