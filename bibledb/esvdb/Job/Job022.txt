001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 
002 `Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself. 
003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless? 
004 Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you? 
005 Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities. 
006 For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
007 You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 
008 The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it. 
009 You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed. 
010 Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you, 
011 or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 
012 `Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are! 
013 But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness? 
014 Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.' 
015 Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod? 
016 They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away. 
017 They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?' 
018 Yet he filled their houses with good things- but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
019 The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them, 
020 saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.' 
021 `Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you. 
022 Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart. 
023 If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents, 
024 if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed, 
025 then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver. 
026 For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. 
027 You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 
028 You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. 
029 For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly. 
030 He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.`
