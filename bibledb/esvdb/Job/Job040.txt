001 And the LORD said to Job: 
002 `Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.` 
003 Then Job answered the LORD and said: 
004 `Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 
005 I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further.` 
006 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: 
007 `Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. 
008 Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right? 
009 Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? 
010 `Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor. 
011 Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him. 
012 Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand. 
013 Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below. 
014 Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you. 
015 `Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. 
016 Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. 
017 He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 
018 His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. 
019 `He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! 
020 For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. 
021 Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh. 
022 For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him. 
023 Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth. 
024 Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?
