001 `Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. 
002 What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 
003 But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God. 
004 As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all. 
005 Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom! 
006 Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips. 
007 Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him? 
008 Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God? 
009 Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man? 
010 He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality. 
011 Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you? 
012 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. 
013 `Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may. 
014 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand? 
015 Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face. 
016 This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him. 
017 Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears. 
018 Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right. 
019 Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die. 
020 Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face: 
021 withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me. 
022 Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me. 
023 How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin. 
024 Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy? 
025 Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff? 
026 For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 
027 You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet. 
028 Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
