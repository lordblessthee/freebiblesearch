001 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 
002 `Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me. 
003 I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me. 
004 Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth, 
005 that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment? 
006 Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, 
007 he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 
008 He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 
009 The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him. 
010 His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth. 
011 His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust. 
012 `Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, 
013 though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth, 
014 yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him. 
015 He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly. 
016 He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him. 
017 He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds. 
018 He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment. 
019 For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build. 
020 `Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him. 
021 There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure. 
022 In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him. 
023 To fill his belly to the full God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body. 
024 He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through. 
025 It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him. 
026 Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed. 
027 The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him. 
028 The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath. 
029 This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God.`
