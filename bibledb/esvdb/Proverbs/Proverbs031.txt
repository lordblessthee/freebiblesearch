001 The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him: 
002 What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows? 
003 Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings. 
004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink, 
005 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted. 
006 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress; 
007 let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. 
008 Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. 
009 Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy. 
010 An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. 
011 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. 
012 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. 
013 She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands. 
014 She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar. 
015 She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens. 
016 She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. 
017 She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. 
018 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. 
019 She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. 
020 She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. 
021 She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet. 
022 She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 
023 Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. 
024 She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant. 
025 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. 
026 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. 
027 She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 
028 Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 
029 `Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.` 
030 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 
031 Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.
