001 Wisdom has built her house;she has hewn her seven pillars. 
002 She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 
003 She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, 
004 `Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!` To him who lacks sense she says, 
005 `Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. 
006 Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.` 
007 Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. 
008 Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. 
009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 
010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. 
011 For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. 
012 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it. 
013 The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing. 
014 She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town, 
015 calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way, 
016 `Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!` And to him who lacks sense she says, 
017 `Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.` 
018 But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
