001 My son, keep my wordsand treasure up my commandments with you; 
002 keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye; 
003 bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 
004 Say to wisdom, `You are my sister,` and call insight your intimate friend, 
005 to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words. 
006 For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice, 
007 and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense, 
008 passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house 
009 in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness. 
010 And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart. 
011 She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home; 
012 now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait. 
013 She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him, 
014 `I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows; 
015 so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you. 
016 I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen; 
017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
018 Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love. 
019 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey; 
020 he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home.` 
021 With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him. 
022 All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast 
023 till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life. 
024 And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. 
025 Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths, 
026 for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng. 
027 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
