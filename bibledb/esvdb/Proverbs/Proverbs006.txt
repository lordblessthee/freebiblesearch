001 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger, 
002 if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth, 
003 then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor. 
004 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; 
005 save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
006 Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. 
007 Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, 
008 she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest. 
009 How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? 
010 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, 
011 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man. 
012 A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, 
013 winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, 
014 with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; 
015 therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. 
016 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
017 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
018 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
019 a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. 
020 My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. 
021 Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck. 
022 When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you. 
023 For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, 
024 to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress. 
025 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; 
026 for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life. 
027 Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned? 
028 Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched? 
029 So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished. 
030 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry, 
031 but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house. 
032 He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself. 
033 Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away. 
034 For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge. 
035 He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.
