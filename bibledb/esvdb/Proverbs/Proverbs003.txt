001 My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, 
002 for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. 
003 Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 
004 So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man. 
005 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 
006 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. 
007 Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil. 
008 It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones. 
009 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; 
010 then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine. 
011 My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof, 
012 for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. 
013 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, 
014 for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. 
015 She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. 
016 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 
017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 
018 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed. 
019 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; 
020 by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew. 
021 My son, do not lose sight of these- keep sound wisdom and discretion, 
022 and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. 
023 Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. 
024 If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 
025 Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes, 
026 for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. 
027 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. 
028 Do not say to your neighbor, `Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it`- when you have it with you. 
029 Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. 
030 Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm. 
031 Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways, 
032 for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence. 
033 The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous. 
034 Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor. 
035 The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.
