001 When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you, 
002 and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite. 
003 Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food. 
004 Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. 
005 When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven. 
006 Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy; do not desire his delicacies, 
007 for he is like one who is inwardly calculating. `Eat and drink!` he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 
008 You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words. 
009 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the good sense of your words. 
010 Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless, 
011 for their Redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you. 
012 Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge. 
013 Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die. 
014 If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol. 
015 My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad. 
016 My inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right. 
017 Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day. 
018 Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 
019 Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way. 
020 Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat, 
021 for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags. 
022 Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. 
023 Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding. 
024 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him. 
025 Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice. 
026 My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. 
027 For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well. 
028 She lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind. 
029 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? 
030 Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine. 
031 Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. 
032 In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. 
033 Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart utter perverse things. 
034 You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast. 
035 `They struck me,` you will say, `but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink.`
