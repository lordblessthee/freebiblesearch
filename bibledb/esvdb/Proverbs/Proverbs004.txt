001 Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight, 
002 for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching. 
003 When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, 
004 he taught me and said to me, `Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live. 
005 Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. 
006 Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you. 
007 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight. 
008 Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. 
009 She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.` 
010 Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many. 
011 I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness. 
012 When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble. 
013 Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. 
014 Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil. 
015 Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on. 
016 For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble. 
017 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 
018 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. 
019 The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. 
020 My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. 
021 Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart. 
022 For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh. 
023 Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. 
024 Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you. 
025 Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you. 
026 Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure. 
027 Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.
