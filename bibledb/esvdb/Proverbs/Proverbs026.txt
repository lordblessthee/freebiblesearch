001 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. 
002 Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight. 
003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools. 
004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself. 
005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. 
006 Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. 
007 Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
008 Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool. 
009 Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
010 Like an archer who wounds everybody is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard. 
011 Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. 
012 Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 
013 The sluggard says, `There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!` 
014 As a door turns on its hinges, so does a sluggard on his bed. 
015 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth. 
016 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly. 
017 Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears. 
018 Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death 
019 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, `I am only joking!` 
020 For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases. 
021 As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. 
022 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body. 
023 Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart. 
024 Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart; 
025 when he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart; 
026 though his hatred be covered with deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. 
027 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling. 
028 A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
