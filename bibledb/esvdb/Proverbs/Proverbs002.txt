001 My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, 
002 making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; 
003 yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, 
004 if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, 
005 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. 
006 For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; 
007 he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 
008 guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. 
009 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; 
010 for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; 
011 discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, 
012 delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, 
013 who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, 
014 who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, 
015 men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. 
016 So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, 
017 who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; 
018 for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; 
019 none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. 
020 So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. 
021 For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, 
022 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
