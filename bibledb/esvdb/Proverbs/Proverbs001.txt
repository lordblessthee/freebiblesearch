001 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: 
002 To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, 
003 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; 
004 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth- 
005 Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, 
006 to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles. 
007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
008 Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching, 
009 for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. 
010 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 
011 If they say, `Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; 
012 like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; 
013 we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; 
014 throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse`- 
015 my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths, 
016 for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. 
017 For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird, 
018 but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. 
019 Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors. 
020 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; 
021 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: 
022 `How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? 
023 If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. 
024 Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, 
025 because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof, 
026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, 
027 when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. 
028 Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. 
029 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, 
030 would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, 
031 therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. 
032 For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; 
033 but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.`
