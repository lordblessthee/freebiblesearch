001 Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. 
002 For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
003 While people are saying, `There is peace and security,` then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 
004 But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. 
005 For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. 
006 So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. 
007 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. 
008 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 
009 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
010 who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 
011 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing. 
012 We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 
013 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
014 And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. 
015 See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. 
016 Rejoice always, 
017 pray without ceasing, 
018 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 
019 Do not quench the Spirit. 
020 Do not despise prophecies, 
021 but test everything; hold fast what is good. 
022 Abstain from every form of evil. 
023 Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
024 He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it. 
025 Brothers, pray for us. 
026 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
027 I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers. 
028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
