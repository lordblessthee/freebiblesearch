001 Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone, 
002 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith, 
003 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. 
004 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to pass, and just as you know. 
005 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn about your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain. 
006 But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us, as we long to see you- 
007 for this reason, brothers, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith. 
008 For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord. 
009 For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God, 
010 as we pray most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith? 
011 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, 
012 and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, 
013 so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
