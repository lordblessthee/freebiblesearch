001 The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
002 `Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head. 
003 From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, company by company. 
004 And there shall be with you a man from each tribe, each man being the head of the house of his fathers. 
005 And these are the names of the men who shall assist you. From Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; 
006 from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;

044 These are those who were listed, whom Moses and Aaron listed with the help of the chiefs of Israel, twelve men, each representing his fathers' house. 
045 So all those listed of the people of Israel, by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war in Israel- 
046 all those listed were 603,550. 
047 But the Levites were not listed along with them by their ancestral tribe. 
048 For the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
049 `Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel. 
050 But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and shall camp around the tabernacle. 
051 When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death. 
052 The people of Israel shall pitch their tents by their companies, each man in his own camp and each man by his own standard. 
053 But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the people of Israel. And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony.` 
054 Thus did the people of Israel; they did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
