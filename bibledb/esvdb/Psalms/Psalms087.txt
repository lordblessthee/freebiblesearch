001 A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A SONG. On the holy mount stands the city he founded; 
002 the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. 
003 Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah 
004 Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush- `This one was born there,` they say. 
005 And of Zion it shall be said, `This one and that one were born in her`; for the Most High himself will establish her. 
006 The LORD records as he registers the peoples, `This one was born there.` Selah 
007 Singers and dancers alike say, `All my springs are in you.`
