001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults! 
002 You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah 
003 For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head. 
004 He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever. 
005 His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him. 
006 For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence. 
007 For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. 
008 Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you. 
009 You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them. 
010 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from among the children of man. 
011 Though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed. 
012 For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows. 
013 Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.
