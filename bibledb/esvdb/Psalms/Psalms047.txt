001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! 
002 For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth. 
003 He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 
004 He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah 
005 God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
006 Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 
007 For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm! 
008 God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne. 
009 The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!
