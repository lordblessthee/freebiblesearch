001 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF SOLOMON. Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. 
002 It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep. 
003 Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward. 
004 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. 
005 Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
