001 Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples! 
002 Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works! 
003 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice! 
004 Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually! 
005 Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered, 
006 O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones! 
007 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 
008 He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, 
009 the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, 
010 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
011 saying, `To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.` 
012 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it, 
013 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, 
014 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account, 
015 saying, `Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!` 
016 When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread, 
017 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 
018 His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron; 
019 until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him. 
020 The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free; 
021 he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions, 
022 to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom. 
023 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
024 And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes. 
025 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. 
026 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 
027 They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham. 
028 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words. 
029 He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die. 
030 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 
031 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. 
032 He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land. 
033 He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. 
034 He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number, 
035 which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground. 
036 He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength. 
037 Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. 
038 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it. 
039 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night. 
040 They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance. 
041 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river. 
042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant. 
043 So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing. 
044 And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil, 
045 that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!
