001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM. A SONG. May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face to shine upon us, Selah 
002 that your way may be known on earth, your saving power among all nations. 
003 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you! 
004 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you judge the peoples with equity and guide the nations upon earth. Selah 
005 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you! 
006 The earth has yielded its increase; God, our God, shall bless us. 
007 God shall bless us; let all the ends of the earth fear him!
