001 A PRAYER OF ONE AFFLICTED, WHEN HE IS FAINT AND POURS OUT HIS COMPLAINT BEFORE THE LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you! 
002 Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call! 
003 For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. 
004 My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread. 
005 Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh. 
006 I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places; 
007 I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop. 
008 All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse. 
009 For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink, 
010 because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down. 
011 My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass. 
012 But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations. 
013 You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come. 
014 For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust. 
015 Nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory. 
016 For the LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory; 
017 he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer. 
018 Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD: 
019 that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD looked at the earth, 
020 to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die, 
021 that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise, 
022 when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD. 
023 He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days. 
024 `O my God,` I say, `take me not away in the midst of my days- you whose years endure throughout all generations!` 
025 Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 
026 They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, 
027 but you are the same, and your years have no end. 
028 The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.
