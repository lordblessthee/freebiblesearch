001 Shout for joy in the LORD, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright. 
002 Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; make melody to him with the harp of ten strings! 
003 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts. 
004 For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. 
005 He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD. 
006 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
007 He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the deeps in storehouses. 
008 Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him! 
009 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. 
010 The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples. 
011 The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations. 
012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage! 
013 The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man; 
014 from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, 
015 he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds. 
016 The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. 
017 The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue. 
018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love, 
019 that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine. 
020 Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. 
021 For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name. 
022 Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you.
