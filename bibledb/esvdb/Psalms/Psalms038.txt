001 A PSALM OF DAVID, FOR THE MEMORIAL OFFERING. O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath! 
002 For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me. 
003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin. 
004 For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. 
005 My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness, 
006 I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning. 
007 For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
008 I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart. 
009 O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you. 
010 My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes- it also has gone from me. 
011 My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off. 
012 Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long. 
013 But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth. 
014 I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes. 
015 But for you, O LORD, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer. 
016 For I said, `Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!` 
017 For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me. 
018 I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin. 
019 But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully. 
020 Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good. 
021 Do not forsake me, O LORD! O my God, be not far from me! 
022 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
