001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. 
002 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken. 
003 How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 
004 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah 
005 For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. 
006 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken. 
007 On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. 
008 Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 
009 Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath. 
010 Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them. 
011 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God, 
012 and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.
