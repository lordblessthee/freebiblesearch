001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O LORD, you have searched me and known me! 
002 You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. 
003 You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. 
004 Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether. 
005 You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me. 
006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain it. 
007 Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? 
008 If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there! 
009 If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, 
010 even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. 
011 If I say, `Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night,` 
012 even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you. 
013 For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. 
014 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. 
015 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. 
016 Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there were none of them. 
017 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! 
018 If I would count them, they are more than the sand. I awake, and I am still with you. 
019 Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God! O men of blood, depart from me! 
020 They speak against you with malicious intent; your enemies take your name in vain! 
021 Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? 
022 I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies. 
023 Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! 
024 And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!
