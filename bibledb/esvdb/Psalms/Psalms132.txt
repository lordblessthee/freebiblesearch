001 A SONG OF ASCENTS.Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured, 
002 how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob, 
003 `I will not enter my house or get into my bed, 
004 I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, 
005 until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.` 
006 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar. 
007 `Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!` 
008 Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. 
009 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy. 
010 For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one. 
011 The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: `One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne. 
012 If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne.` 
013 For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place: 
014 `This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 
015 I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
016 Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy. 
017 There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed. 
018 His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine.`
