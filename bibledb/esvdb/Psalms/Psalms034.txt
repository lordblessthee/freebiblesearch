001 OF DAVID, WHEN HE CHANGED HIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE ABIMELECH, SO THAT HE DROVE HIM OUT, AND HE WENT AWAY. I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 
002 My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad. 
003 Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together! 
004 I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. 
005 Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed. 
006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. 
007 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 
008 Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him! 
009 Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack! 
010 The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. 
011 Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
012 What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? 
013 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. 
014 Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. 
015 The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. 
016 The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
017 When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. 
018 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. 
019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all. 
020 He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. 
021 Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. 
022 The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
