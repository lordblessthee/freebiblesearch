001 Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! 
002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble 
003 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 
004 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in; 
005 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them. 
006 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. 
007 He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in. 
008 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men! 
009 For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things. 
010 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons, 
011 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High. 
012 So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help. 
013 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. 
014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart. 
015 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men! 
016 For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron. 
017 Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction; 
018 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death. 
019 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. 
020 He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction. 
021 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men! 
022 And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy! 
023 Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters; 
024 they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep. 
025 For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea. 
026 They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight; 
027 they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits' end. 
028 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. 
029 He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed. 
030 Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven. 
031 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of men! 
032 Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
033 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground, 
034 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants. 
035 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water. 
036 And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in; 
037 they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield. 
038 By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish. 
039 When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil, and sorrow, 
040 he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes; 
041 but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks. 
042 The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth. 
043 Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.
