001 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF DAVID.I was glad when they said to me, `Let us go to the house of the LORD!` 
002 Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem! 
003 Jerusalem- built as a city that is bound firmly together, 
004 to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
005 There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David. 
006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! `May they be secure who love you! 
007 Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!` 
008 For my brothers and companions' sake I will say, `Peace be within you!` 
009 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.
