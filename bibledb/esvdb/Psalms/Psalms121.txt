001 A SONG OF ASCENTS.I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? 
002 My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
003 He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber. 
004 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 
005 The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand. 
006 The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. 
007 The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life. 
008 The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
