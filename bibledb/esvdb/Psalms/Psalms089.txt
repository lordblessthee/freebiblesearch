001 A MASKIL OF ETHAN THE EZRAHITE. I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. 
002 For I said, `Steadfast love will be built up forever; in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness.` 
003 You have said, `I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant: 
004 'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'`Selah 
005 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones! 
006 For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD, 
007 a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him? 
008 O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you? 
009 You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them. 
010 You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm. 
011 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them. 
012 The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name. 
013 You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand. 
014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you. 
015 Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face, 
016 who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted. 
017 For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted. 
018 For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel. 
019 Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: `I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 
020 I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him, 
021 so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him. 
022 The enemy shall not outwit him; the wicked shall not humble him. 
023 I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him. 
024 My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 
025 I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. 
026 He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.' 
027 And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 
028 My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him. 
029 I will establish his offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens. 
030 If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules, 
031 if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments, 
032 then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, 
033 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness. 
034 I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips. 
035 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David. 
036 His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me. 
037 Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies.` Selah 
038 But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed. 
039 You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust. 
040 You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins. 
041 All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors. 
042 You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice. 
043 You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle. 
044 You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground. 
045 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah 
046 How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire? 
047 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man! 
048 What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah 
049 Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David? 
050 Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations, 
051 with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed. 
052 Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.
