001 A PSALM OF ASAPH.Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. 
002 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped. 
003 For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
004 For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek. 
005 They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind. 
006 Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment. 
007 Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies. 
008 They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. 
009 They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth. 
010 Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them. 
011 And they say, `How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?` 
012 Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches. 
013 All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence. 
014 For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning. 
015 If I had said, `I will speak thus,` I would have betrayed the generation of your children. 
016 But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task, 
017 until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end. 
018 Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin. 
019 How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors! 
020 Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms. 
021 When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart, 
022 I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. 
023 Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. 
024 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. 
025 Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. 
026 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 
027 For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you. 
028 But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
