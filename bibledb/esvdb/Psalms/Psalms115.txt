001 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness! 
002 Why should the nations say, `Where is their God?` 
003 Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases. 
004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 
005 They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. 
006 They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. 
007 They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. 
008 Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them. 
009 O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
011 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
012 The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 
013 he will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great. 
014 May the LORD give you increase, you and your children! 
015 May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth! 
016 The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man. 
017 The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence. 
018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
