001 A PSALM OF DAVID. The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, 
002 for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. 
003 Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place? 
004 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully. 
005 He will receive blessing from the LORD and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
006 Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah 
007 Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle! 
009 Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah
