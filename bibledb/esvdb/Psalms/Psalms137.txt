001 By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion. 
002 On the willows there we hung up our lyres. 
003 For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, `Sing us one of the songs of Zion!` 
004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land? 
005 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! 
006 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy! 
007 Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, `Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!` 
008 O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed, blessed shall he be who repays you with what you have done to us! 
009 Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!
