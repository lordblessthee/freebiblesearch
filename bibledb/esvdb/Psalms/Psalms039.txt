001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: TO JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. I said, `I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence.` 
002 I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse. 
003 My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: 
004 `O LORD, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am! 
005 Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah 
006 Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather! 
007 `And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you. 
008 Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool! 
009 I am mute; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it. 
010 Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand. 
011 When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah 
012 `Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers. 
013 Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!`
