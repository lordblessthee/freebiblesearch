001 A SONG OF PRAISE. OF DAVID. I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever. 
002 Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever. 
003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. 
004 One generation shall commend your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts. 
005 On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. 
006 They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds, and I will declare your greatness. 
007 They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. 
008 The LORD is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 
009 The LORD is good to all, and his mercy is over all that he has made. 
010 All your works shall give thanks to you, O LORD, and all your saints shall bless you! 
011 They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your power, 
012 to make known to the children of man your mighty deeds, and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. 
013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations. [The LORD is faithful in all his words and kind in all his works.] 
014 The LORD upholds all who are falling and raises up all who are bowed down. 
015 The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food in due season. 
016 You open your hand; you satisfy the desire of every living thing. 
017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his works. 
018 The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 
019 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he also hears their cry and saves them. 
020 The LORD preserves all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy. 
021 My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
