001 Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever! 
002 Let Israel say, `His steadfast love endures forever.` 
003 Let the house of Aaron say, `His steadfast love endures forever.` 
004 Let those who fear the LORD say, `His steadfast love endures forever.` 
005 Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free. 
006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? 
007 The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me. 
008 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man. 
009 It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes. 
010 All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 
011 They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 
012 They surrounded me like bees; they went out like a fire among thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 
013 I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me. 
014 The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. 
015 Glad songs of salvation are in the tents of the righteous: `The right hand of the LORD does valiantly, 
016 the right hand of the LORD exalts, the right hand of the LORD does valiantly!` 
017 I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD. 
018 The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death. 
019 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. 
020 This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it. 
021 I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation. 
022 The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. 
023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. 
024 This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. 
025 Save us, we pray, O LORD! O LORD, we pray, give us success! 
026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD! We bless you from the house of the LORD. 
027 The LORD is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar! 
028 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; you are my God; I will extol you. 
029 Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!
