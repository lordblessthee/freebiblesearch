001 OF DAVID. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name! 
002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, 
003 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, 
004 who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, 
005 who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
006 The LORD works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed. 
007 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel. 
008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 
009 He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. 
010 He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. 
011 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; 
012 as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. 
013 As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. 
014 For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust. 
015 As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; 
016 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. 
017 But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, 
018 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. 
019 The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. 
020 Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word! 
021 Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will! 
022 Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
