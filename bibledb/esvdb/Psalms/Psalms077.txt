001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF ASAPH. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. 
002 In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted. 
003 When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah 
004 You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
005 I consider the days of old, the years long ago. 
006 I said, `Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart.` Then my spirit made a diligent search: 
007 `Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable? 
008 Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time? 
009 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?` Selah 
010 Then I said, `I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High.` 
011 I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old. 
012 I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds. 
013 Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God? 
014 You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples. 
015 You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
016 When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled. 
017 The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side. 
018 The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook. 
019 Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. 
020 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
