001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him; 
002 the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies. 
003 The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health. 
004 As for me, I said, `O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!` 
005 My enemies say of me in malice, `When will he die and his name perish?` 
006 And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad. 
007 All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me. 
008 They say, `A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies.` 
009 Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. 
010 But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them! 
011 By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me. 
012 But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever. 
013 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
