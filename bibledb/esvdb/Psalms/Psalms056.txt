001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO THE DOVE ON FAR-OFF TEREBINTHS. A MIKTAM OF DAVID, WHEN THE PHILISTINES SEIZED HIM IN GATH. Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me; 
002 my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly. 
003 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. 
004 In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? 
005 All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
006 They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life. 
007 For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God! 
008 You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book? 
009 Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me. 
010 In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise, 
011 in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me? 
012 I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you. 
013 For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
