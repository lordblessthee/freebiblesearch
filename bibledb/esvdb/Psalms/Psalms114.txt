001 When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 
002 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 
003 The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back. 
004 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 
005 What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 
006 O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs? 
007 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 
008 who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
