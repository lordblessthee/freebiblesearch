001 Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth! 
002 Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. 
003 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples! 
004 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. 
005 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. 
006 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
007 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength! 
008 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts! 
009 Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth! 
010 Say among the nations, `The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.` 
011 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it; 
012 let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy 
013 before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
