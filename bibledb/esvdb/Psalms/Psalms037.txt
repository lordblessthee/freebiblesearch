001 OF DAVID. Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers! 
002 For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb. 
003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. 
004 Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 
005 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act. 
006 He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday. 
007 Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices! 
008 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil. 
009 For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land. 
010 In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there. 
011 But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace. 
012 The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him, 
013 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming. 
014 The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright; 
015 their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 
016 Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked. 
017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. 
018 The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever; 
019 they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance. 
020 But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish- like smoke they vanish away. 
021 The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives; 
022 for those blessed by the LORD shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off. 
023 The steps of a man are established by the LORD, when he delights in his way; 
024 though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD upholds his hand. 
025 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread. 
026 He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing. 
027 Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever. 
028 For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off. 
029 The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever. 
030 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. 
031 The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip. 
032 The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death. 
033 The LORD will not abandon him to his power or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial. 
034 Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off. 
035 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree. 
036 But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found. 
037 Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace. 
038 But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off. 
039 The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 
040 The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
