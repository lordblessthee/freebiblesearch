001 Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD! 
002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore! 
003 From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised! 
004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens! 
005 Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high, 
006 who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? 
007 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, 
008 to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people. 
009 He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!
