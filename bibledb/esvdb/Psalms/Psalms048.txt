001 A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, 
002 beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King. 
003 Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress. 
004 For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together. 
005 As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight. 
006 Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor. 
007 By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish. 
008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah 
009 We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple. 
010 As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness. 
011 Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments! 
012 Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers, 
013 consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation 
014 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.
