001 A SONG OF ASCENTS. Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways! 
002 You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you. 
003 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. 
004 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the LORD. 
005 The LORD bless you from Zion! May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life! 
006 May you see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel!
