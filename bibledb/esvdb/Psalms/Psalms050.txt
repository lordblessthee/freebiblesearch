001 A PSALM OF ASAPH. The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. 
002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 
003 Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest. 
004 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people: 
005 `Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!` 
006 The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah 
007 `Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 
008 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me. 
009 I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds. 
010 For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. 
011 I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine. 
012 `If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine. 
013 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 
014 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High, 
015 and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.` 
016 But to the wicked God says: `What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips? 
017 For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. 
018 If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. 
019 `You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. 
020 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son. 
021 These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. 
022 `Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver! 
023 The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!`
