001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO LILIES. A MASKIL OF THE SONS OF KORAH; A LOVE SONG. My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe. 
002 You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. 
003 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty! 
004 In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds! 
005 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you. 
006 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; 
007 you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; 
008 your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad; 
009 daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 
010 Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house, 
011 and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. 
012 The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people. 
013 All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold. 
014 In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her. 
015 With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king. 
016 In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth. 
017 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.
