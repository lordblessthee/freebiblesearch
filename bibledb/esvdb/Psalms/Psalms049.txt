001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world, 
002 both low and high, rich and poor together! 
003 My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. 
004 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre. 
005 Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me, 
006 those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? 
007 Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, 
008 for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice, 
009 that he should live on forever and never see the pit. 
010 For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others. 
011 Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names. 
012 Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. 
013 This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah 
014 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell. 
015 But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah 
016 Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases. 
017 For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him. 
018 For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed,- and though you get praise when you do well for yourself- 
019 his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light. 
020 Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
