001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO DO NOT DESTROY. A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG. We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds. 
002 `At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity. 
003 When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah 
004 I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn; 
005 do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'` 
006 For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up, 
007 but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another. 
008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs. 
009 But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
010 All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
