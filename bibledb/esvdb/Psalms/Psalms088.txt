001 A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO MAHALATH LEANNOTH. A MASKIL OF HEMAN THE EZRAHITE. O LORD, God of my salvation; I cry out day and night before you. 
002 Let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry! 
003 For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol. 
004 I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am a man who has no strength, 
005 like one set loose among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand. 
006 You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep. 
007 Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah 
008 You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape; 
009 my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you. 
010 Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah 
011 Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon? 
012 Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
013 But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you. 
014 O LORD, why do you cast my soul away? Why do you hide your face from me? 
015 Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am helpless. 
016 Your wrath has swept over me; your dreadful assaults destroy me. 
017 They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in on me together. 
018 You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me; my companions have become darkness.
