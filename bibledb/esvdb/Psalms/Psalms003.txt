001 A PSALM OF DAVID, WHEN HE FLED FROM ABSALOM HIS SON. O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; 
002 many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah 
003 But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 
004 I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah 
005 I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the LORD sustained me. 
006 I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around. 
007 Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 
008 Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing be on your people! Selah
