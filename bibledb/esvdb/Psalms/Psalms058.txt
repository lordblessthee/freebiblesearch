001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO DO NOT DESTROY. A MIKTAM OF DAVID. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly? 
002 No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth. 
003 The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies. 
004 They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear, 
005 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter. 
006 O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD! 
007 Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted. 
008 Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun. 
009 Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away! 
010 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
011 Mankind will say, `Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth.`
