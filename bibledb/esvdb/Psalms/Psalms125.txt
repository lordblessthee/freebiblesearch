001 A SONG OF ASCENTS.Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 
002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore. 
003 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wrong. 
004 Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts! 
005 But those who turn aside to their crooked ways the LORD will lead away with evildoers! Peace be upon Israel!
