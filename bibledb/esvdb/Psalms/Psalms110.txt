001 A PSALM OF DAVID. The LORD says to my Lord: `Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.` 
002 The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! 
003 Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. 
004 The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, `You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.` 
005 The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath. 
006 He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth. 
007 He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
