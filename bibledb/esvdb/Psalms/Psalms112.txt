001 Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in his commandments! 
002 His offspring will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. 
003 Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. 
004 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious, merciful, and righteous. 
005 It is well with the man who deals generously and lends; who conducts his affairs with justice. 
006 For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever. 
007 He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD. 
008 His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his adversaries. 
009 He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor. 
010 The wicked man sees it and is angry; he gnashes his teeth and melts away; the desire of the wicked will perish!
