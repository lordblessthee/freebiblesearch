001 OF DAVID.The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
002 When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall. 
003 Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident. 
004 One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple. 
005 For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. 
006 And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD. 
007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me! 
008 You have said, `Seek my face.` My heart says to you, `Your face, LORD, do I seek.` 
009 Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not, O God of my salvation! 
010 For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the LORD will take me in. 
011 Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. 
012 Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence. 
013 I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living! 
014 Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!
