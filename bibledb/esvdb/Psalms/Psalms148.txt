001 Praise the LORD!Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights! 
002 Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts! 
003 Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars! 
004 Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens! 
005 Let them praise the name of the LORD! For he commanded and they were created. 
006 And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away. 
007 Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all deeps, 
008 fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling his word! 
009 Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars! 
010 Beasts and all livestock, creeping things and flying birds! 
011 Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth! 
012 Young men and maidens together, old men and children! 
013 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. 
014 He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his saints, for the people of Israel who are near to him. Praise the LORD!
