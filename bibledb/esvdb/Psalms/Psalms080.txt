001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO LILIES. A TESTIMONY. OF ASAPH, A PSALM. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. 
002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us! 
003 Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 
004 O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers? 
005 You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure. 
006 You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. 
007 Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 
008 You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. 
009 You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land. 
010 The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 
011 It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River. 
012 Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit? 
013 The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it. 
014 Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine, 
015 the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself. 
016 They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face! 
017 But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself! 
018 Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name! 
019 Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! let your face shine, that we may be saved!
