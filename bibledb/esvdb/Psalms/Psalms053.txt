001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO MAHALATH. A MASKIL OF DAVID. The fool says in his heart, `There is no God.` They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good. 
002 God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God. 
003 They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one. 
004 Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God? 
005 There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them. 
006 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
