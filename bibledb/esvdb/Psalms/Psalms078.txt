001 A MASKIL OF ASAPH. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth! 
002 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, 
003 things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. 
004 We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done. 
005 He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, 
006 that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children, 
007 so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments; 
008 and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
009 The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle. 
010 They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law. 
011 They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them. 
012 In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. 
013 He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. 
014 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. 
015 He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. 
016 He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers. 
017 Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. 
018 They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. 
019 They spoke against God, saying, `Can God spread a table in the wilderness? 
020 He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?` 
021 Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, 
022 because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power. 
023 Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven, 
024 and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven. 
025 Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance. 
026 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind; 
027 he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas; 
028 he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings. 
029 And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved. 
030 But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths, 
031 the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel. 
032 In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe. 
033 So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror. 
034 When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly. 
035 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer. 
036 But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues. 
037 Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant. 
038 Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath. 
039 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again. 
040 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert! 
041 They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
042 They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe, 
043 when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan. 
044 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams. 
045 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. 
046 He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust. 
047 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost. 
048 He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts. 
049 He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels. 
050 He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague. 
051 He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
052 Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
053 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
054 And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won. 
055 He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
056 Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies, 
057 but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow. 
058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols. 
059 When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel. 
060 He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind, 
061 and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe. 
062 He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage. 
063 Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song. 
064 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. 
065 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine. 
066 And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame. 
067 He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, 
068 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves. 
069 He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever. 
070 He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds; 
071 from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance. 
072 With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.
