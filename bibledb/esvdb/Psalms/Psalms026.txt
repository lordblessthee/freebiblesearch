001 OF DAVID. Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. 
002 Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. 
003 For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness. 
004 I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites. 
005 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked. 
006 I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O LORD, 
007 proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds. 
008 O LORD, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells. 
009 Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, 
010 in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes. 
011 But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me. 
012 My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.
