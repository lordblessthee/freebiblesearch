001 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF DAVID. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side- let Israel now say- 
002 if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, 
003 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; 
004 then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 
005 then over us would have gone the raging waters. 
006 Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 
007 We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 
008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
