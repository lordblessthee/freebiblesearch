001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A MASKIL OF THE SONS OF KORAH. O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old: 
002 you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free; 
003 for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them. 
004 You are my King, O God; ordain salvation for Jacob! 
005 Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us. 
006 For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me. 
007 But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us. 
008 In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah 
009 But you have rejected us and disgraced us and have not gone out with our armies. 
010 You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil. 
011 You have made us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations. 
012 You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them. 
013 You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us. 
014 You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. 
015 All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face 
016 at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger. 
017 All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant. 
018 Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way; 
019 yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death. 
020 If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, 
021 would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart. 
022 Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered. 
023 Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever! 
024 Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression? 
025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground. 
026 Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love!
