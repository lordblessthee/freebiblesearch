001 The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. 
002 Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. 
003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. 
004 Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty! 
005 Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
