001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER: ACCORDING TO SHUSHAN EDUTH. A MIKTAM OF DAVID; FOR INSTRUCTION; WHEN HE STROVE WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM AND WITH ARAM-ZOBAH, AND WHEN JOAB ON HIS RETURN STRUCK DOWN TWELVE THOUSAND OF EDOM IN THE VALLEY OF SALT. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us. 
002 You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters. 
003 You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger. 
004 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah 
005 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us! 
006 God has spoken in his holiness: `With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth. 
007 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. 
008 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.` 
009 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
010 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies. 
011 Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 
012 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
