001 I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. 
002 Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 
003 The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. 
004 Then I called on the name of the LORD: `O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!` 
005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful. 
006 The LORD preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me. 
007 Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you. 
008 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling; 
009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
010 I believed, even when I spoke, `I am greatly afflicted`; 
011 I said in my alarm, `All mankind are liars.` 
012 What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits to me? 
013 I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD, 
014 I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. 
015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
016 O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. 
017 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD. 
018 I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, 
019 in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
