001 A PSALM OF DAVID.The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
002 He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
003 He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 
004 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
005 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
