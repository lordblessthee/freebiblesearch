001 Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 
002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his anointed, saying, 
003 `Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.` 
004 He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. 
005 Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 
006 `As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.` 
007 I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, `You are my Son; today I have begotten you. 
008 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 
009 You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.` 
010 Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. 
011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
