001 OF DAVID.To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul. 
002 O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me. 
003 Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous. 
004 Make me to know your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths. 
005 Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long. 
006 Remember your mercy, O LORD, and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old. 
007 Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O LORD! 
008 Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 
009 He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way. 
010 All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
011 For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great. 
012 Who is the man who fears the LORD? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose. 
013 His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land. 
014 The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant. 
015 My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for he will pluck my feet out of the net. 
016 Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. 
017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses. 
018 Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins. 
019 Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me. 
020 Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you. 
021 May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you. 
022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
