001 Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! 
002 Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, or declare all his praise? 
003 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! 
004 Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them, 
005 that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance. 
006 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness. 
007 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the Sea, at the Red Sea. 
008 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power. 
009 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 
010 So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy. 
011 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 
012 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 
013 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. 
014 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert; 
015 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them. 
016 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD, 
017 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
018 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
019 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image. 
020 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. 
021 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 
022 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 
023 Therefore he said he would destroy them- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them. 
024 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise. 
025 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD. 
026 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness, 
027 and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands. 
028 Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead; 
029 they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 
030 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed. 
031 And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever. 
032 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account, 
033 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips. 
034 They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them, 
035 but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did. 
036 They served their idols, which became a snare to them. 
037 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons; 
038 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood. 
039 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds. 
040 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage; 
041 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them. 
042 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power. 
043 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity. 
044 Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry. 
045 For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love. 
046 He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive. 
047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. 
048 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, `Amen!` Praise the LORD!
