001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. OF DAVID, FOR THE MEMORIAL OFFERING. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me! 
002 Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt! 
003 Let them turn back because of their shame who say, `Aha, Aha!` 
004 May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, `God is great!` 
005 But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!
