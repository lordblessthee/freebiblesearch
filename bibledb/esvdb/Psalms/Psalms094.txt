001 O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth! 
002 Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve! 
003 O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult? 
004 They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. 
005 They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage. 
006 They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless; 
007 and they say, `The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.` 
008 Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise? 
009 He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? 
010 He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge- 
011 the LORD- knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath. 
012 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law, 
013 to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. 
014 For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage; 
015 for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 
016 Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers? 
017 If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence. 
018 When I thought, `My foot slips,` your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up. 
019 When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. 
020 Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute? 
021 They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 
022 But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge. 
023 He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
