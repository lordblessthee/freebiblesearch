001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A MASKIL OF DAVID, WHEN DOEG, THE EDOMITE, CAME AND TOLD SAUL, `DAVID HAS COME TO THE HOUSE OF AHIMELECH.` Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day. 
002 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit. 
003 You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah 
004 You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue. 
005 But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 
006 The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying, 
007 `See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!` 
008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever. 
009 I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.
