001 Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! 
002 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! 
003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 
004 In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. 
005 The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. 
006 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker! 
007 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice, 
008 do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, 
009 when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. 
010 For forty years I loathed that generation and said, `They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways.` 
011 Therefore I swore in my wrath, `They shall not enter my rest.`
