001 A SHIGGAION OF DAVID, WHICH HE SANG TO THE LORD CONCERNING THE WORDS OF CUSH, A BENJAMINITE. O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me, 
002 lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver. 
003 O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 
004 if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause, 
005 let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah 
006 Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment. 
007 Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high. 
008 The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me. 
009 Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous- you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God! 
010 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 
011 God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day. 
012 If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow; 
013 he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts. 
014 Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. 
015 He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made. 
016 His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends. 
017 I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
