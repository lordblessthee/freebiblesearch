001 A SONG. A PSALM OF DAVID. My heart is steadfast, O God! I will sing and make melody with all my being! 
002 Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn! 
003 I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 
004 For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 
005 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth! 
006 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me! 
007 God has promised in his holiness: `With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth. 
008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter. 
009 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.` 
010 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
011 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies. 
012 Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 
013 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
