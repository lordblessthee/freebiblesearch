001 A SONG. A PSALM OF ASAPH.O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God! 
002 For behold, your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have raised their heads. 
003 They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against your treasured ones. 
004 They say, `Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!` 
005 For they conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant- 
006 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 
007 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
008 Asshur also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah 
009 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, 
010 who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground. 
011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
012 who said, `Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God.` 
013 O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind. 
014 As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze, 
015 so may you pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane! 
016 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O LORD. 
017 Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace, 
018 that they may know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
