001 TO THE CHOIRMASTER. A PSALM OF DAVID. How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 
002 How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
003 Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, 
004 lest my enemy say, `I have prevailed over him,` lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken. 
005 But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation. 
006 I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
