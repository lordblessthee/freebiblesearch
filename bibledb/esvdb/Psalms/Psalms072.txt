001 OF SOLOMON.Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son! 
002 May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice! 
003 Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness! 
004 May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor! 
005 May they fear you while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations! 
006 May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth! 
007 In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more! 
008 May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth! 
009 May desert tribes bow down before him and his enemies lick the dust! 
010 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! 
011 May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! 
012 For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper. 
013 He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy. 
014 From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight. 
015 Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day! 
016 May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field! 
017 May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed! 
018 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things. 
019 Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen! 
020 The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
