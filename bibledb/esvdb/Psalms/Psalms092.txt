001 A PSALM. A SONG FOR THE SABBATH. It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; 
002 to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night, 
003 to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre. 
004 For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy. 
005 How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep! 
006 The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this: 
007 that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever; 
008 but you, O LORD, are on high forever. 
009 For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered. 
010 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil. 
011 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants. 
012 The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
013 They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God. 
014 They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green, 
015 to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
