001 A PSALM OF ASAPH. God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment: 
002 `How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 
003 Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. 
004 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.` 
005 They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
006 I said, `You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; 
007 nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince.` 
008 Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!
