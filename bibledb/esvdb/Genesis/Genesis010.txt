001 These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood. 
002 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
003 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
004 The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
005 From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations. 
006 The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. 
007 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
008 Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man. 
009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, `Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.` 
010 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
011 From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and 
012 Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 
013 Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
014 Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. 
015 Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, 
016 and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
017 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
018 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed. 
019 And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
020 These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations. 
021 To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born. 
022 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 
023 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
024 Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber. 
025 To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan. 
026 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
027 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
028 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
029 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
030 The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east. 
031 These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations. 
032 These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
