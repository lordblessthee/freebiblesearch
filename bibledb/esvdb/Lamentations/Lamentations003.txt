001 I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath; 
002 he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light; 
003 surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long. 
004 He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; he has broken my bones; 
005 he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation; 
006 he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago. 
007 He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has made my chains heavy; 
008 though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer; 
009 he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones; he has made my paths crooked. 
010 He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding; 
011 he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate; 
012 he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow. 
013 He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver; 
014 I have become the laughingstock of all peoples, the object of their taunts all day long. 
015 He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood. 
016 He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes; 
017 my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is; 
018 so I say, `My endurance has perished; so has my hope from the LORD.` 
019 Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall! 
020 My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me. 
021 But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: 
022 The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; 
023 they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. 
024 `The LORD is my portion,` says my soul, `therefore I will hope in him.` 
025 The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. 
026 It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD. 
027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
028 Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him; 
029 let him put his mouth in the dust- there may yet be hope; 
030 let him give his cheek to the one who strikes, and let him be filled with insults. 
031 For the Lord will not cast off forever, 
032 but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love; 
033 for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men. 
034 To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth, 
035 to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High, 
036 to subvert a man in his lawsuit, the Lord does not approve. 
037 Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it? 
038 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come? 
039 Why should a living man complain, a man, about the punishment of his sins? 
040 Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD! 
041 Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven: 
042 `We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven. 
043 `You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity; 
044 you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through. 
045 You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples. 
046 `All our enemies open their mouths against us; 
047 panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction; 
048 my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
049 `My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite, 
050 until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees; 
051 my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city. 
052 `I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause; 
053 they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me; 
054 water closed over my head; I said, 'I am lost.' 
055 `I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit; 
056 you heard my plea, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help!' 
057 You came near when I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear!' 
058 `You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life. 
059 You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause. 
060 You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me. 
061 `You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me. 
062 The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long. 
063 Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their taunts. 
064 `You will repay them, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 
065 You will give them dullness of heart; your curse will be on them. 
066 You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens, O LORD.`
