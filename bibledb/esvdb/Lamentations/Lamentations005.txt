001 Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace! 
002 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 
003 We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows. 
004 We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought. 
005 Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest. 
006 We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough. 
007 Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities. 
008 Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand. 
009 We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness. 
010 Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine. 
011 Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah. 
012 Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders. 
013 Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood. 
014 The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music. 
015 The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning. 
016 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! 
017 For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim, 
018 for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it. 
019 But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations. 
020 Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days? 
021 Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old- 
022 unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us.
