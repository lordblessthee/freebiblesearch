001 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. 
002 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 
003 So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
004 Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, `Whom do you seek?` 
005 They answered him, `Jesus of Nazareth.` Jesus said to them, `I am he.` Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 
006 When Jesus said to them, `I am he,` they drew back and fell to the ground. 
007 So he asked them again, `Whom do you seek?` And they said, `Jesus of Nazareth.` 
008 Jesus answered, `I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.` 
009 This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: `Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.` 
010 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) 
011 So Jesus said to Peter, `Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?` 
012 So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. 
013 First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
014 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people. 
015 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest, 
016 but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. 
017 The servant girl at the door said to Peter, `You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?` He said, `I am not.` 
018 Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. 
019 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 
020 Jesus answered him, `I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. 
021 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.` 
022 When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, `Is that how you answer the high priest?` 
023 Jesus answered him, `If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?` 
024 Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. 
025 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, `You also are not one of his disciples, are you?` He denied it and said, `I am not.` 
026 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, `Did I not see you in the garden with him?` 
027 Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed. 
028 Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. 
029 So Pilate went outside to them and said, `What accusation do you bring against this man?` 
030 They answered him, `If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.` 
031 Pilate said to them, `Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.` The Jews said to him, `It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.` 
032 This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die. 
033 So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, `Are you the King of the Jews?` 
034 Jesus answered, `Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?` 
035 Pilate answered, `Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?` 
036 Jesus answered, `My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.` 
037 Then Pilate said to him, `So you are a king?` Jesus answered, `You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world- to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.` 
038 Pilate said to him, `What is truth?` After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, `I find no guilt in him. 
039 But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?` 
040 They cried out again, `Not this man, but Barabbas!` Now Barabbas was a robber.
