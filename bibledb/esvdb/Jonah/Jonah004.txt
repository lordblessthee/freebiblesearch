001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. 
002 And he prayed to the LORD and said, `O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. 
003 Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.` 
004 And the LORD said, `Do you do well to be angry?` 
005 Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. 
006 Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. 
007 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. 
008 When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, `It is better for me to die than to live.` 
009 But God said to Jonah, `Do you do well to be angry for the plant?` And he said, `Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.` 
010 And the LORD said, `You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. 
011 And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?`
