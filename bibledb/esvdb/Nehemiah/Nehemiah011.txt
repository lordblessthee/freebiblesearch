001 Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem. And the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem the holy city, while nine out of ten remained in the other towns. 
002 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem. 
003 These are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem; but in the towns of Judah everyone lived on his property in their towns: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Sol-omon's servants. 
004 And in Jerusalem lived certain of the sons of Judah and of the sons of Benjamin. Of the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; 
005 and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, son of the Shilonite. 
006 All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were 468 valiant men. 
007 And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah, 
008 and his brothers, men of valor, 928. 
009 Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city. 
010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 
011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, ruler of the house of God, 
012 and their brothers who did the work of the house, 822; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah, 
013 and his brothers, heads of fathers' houses, 242; and Amashsai, the son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, 
014 and their brothers, mighty men of valor, 128; their overseer was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim. 
015 And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; 
016 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who were over the outside work of the house of God; 
017 and Mattaniah the son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who was the leader of the praise, who gave thanks, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. 
018 All the Levites in the holy city were 284. 
019 The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brothers, who kept watch at the gates, were 172. 
020 And the rest of Israel, and of the priests and the Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 
021 But the temple servants lived on Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants. 
022 The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the work of the house of God. 
023 For there was a command from the king concerning them, and a fixed provision for the singers, as every day required. 
024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's side in all matters concerning the people. 
025 And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
026 and in Jeshua and in Moladah and Beth-pelet, 
027 in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its villages, 
028 in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages, 
029 in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
030 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its villages. So they encamped from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom. 
031 The people of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages, 
032 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 
036 And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah were assigned to Benjamin.
